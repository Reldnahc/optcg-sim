# Effect Runtime

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s001 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s001`

## Overview

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s002 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s002`

The effect runtime executes effect definitions against the authoritative game state.

```text
Effect definitions        Runtime                 Engine core
DSL + custom handlers --> queue/choices/events --> atomic state mutations
```

The runtime must preserve timing, hidden information, source-presence rules, replacement effects, and deterministic replay.

**v6 contract:** queue entries, decisions, replacement state, and continuous-effect records are defined in [`contracts/canonical-types.ts`](contracts/canonical-types.ts). The algorithms below are normative when they are more precise than older snippets.

## Effect categories

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s003 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s003`

| Category    | Runtime behavior                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto        | Detected from `EngineEvent`s and queued.                   |
| Activate    | Exposed through legal actions during valid timing windows. |
| Permanent   | Contributes continuous modifiers to computed view.         |
| Replacement | Intercepts replaceable processes before atomic mutation.   |

wrapper or entry-point adapter responsibilities are timing window selection, legal-action exposure or queueing, source-presence policy selection, once-per-turn marker handling, and activation commitment semantics. wrapper semantics are distinct from reusable effect body primitive semantics.

## Stable effect identity

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s004 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s004`

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

## Card implementation support

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s005 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s005`

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Parser certification evidence must expose stable primitive boundaries for wrapper or entry point, markers, conditions, costs, body effects, targets, filters, cardinality, durations, visibility, source-presence policy, and composition when present. Runtime capability evidence must prove reusable runtime behavior for the same primitive boundaries plus decision or response semantics when present.

Composition evidence may be required for supported combined shapes, but composition evidence cannot replace missing wrapper, body, cost, target, condition, duration, source policy, decision, or visibility evidence.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

## Effect queue entry

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s006 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s006`

```ts
interface EffectQueueEntry {
  id: QueueEntryId;
  state: "pending" | "resolving" | "resolved" | "cancelled";
  timingWindowId: TimingWindowId;
  generation: number;
  controllerId: PlayerId;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  triggerEventId?: EngineEventId;
  effectBlockId: EffectId;
  orderingGroup: "turnPlayer" | "nonTurnPlayer";
  createdAtEventSeq: number;
  queuedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  sourcePresencePolicy: SourcePresencePolicy;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
}
```

## Source presence policy

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s007 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s007`

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

wrapper or entry-point adapter responsibilities are timing window selection, legal-action exposure or queueing, source-presence policy selection, once-per-turn marker handling, and activation commitment semantics. wrapper semantics are distinct from reusable effect body primitive semantics.

## Trigger detection from events

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s008 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s008`

Trigger detection consumes event batches.

```ts
function detectTriggeredEffects(
  state: GameState,
  events: EngineEvent[],
): TriggerCandidate[] {
  const candidates: TriggerCandidate[] = [];

  for (const event of events) {
    candidates.push(...findAutoEffectsForEvent(state, event));
    candidates.push(...findReplacementFollowupsIfAny(state, event));
  }

  return candidates.filter((c) => canTriggerNow(c, state));
}
```

The engine must check source presence before queueing, then apply the queue entry's source-presence policy before resolution.

## Queue ordering

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s009 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s009`

Every trigger collection creates or joins a timing window. Queue order is deterministic and must not depend on JavaScript array discovery order except where the spec explicitly says discovery order is the canonical tie-breaker.

Normative ordering algorithm:

```text
1. Assign every collected trigger a timingWindowId.
2. Assign generation = 0 for effects triggered by the original timing event.
3. When resolving an effect produces new triggers, enqueue them with generation = currentGeneration + 1 in the same timing window unless a new official timing window has opened.
4. Resolve older timing windows before newer timing windows.
5. Within a timing window, resolve lower generation before higher generation.
6. Within a generation, resolve turn-player bucket before non-turn-player bucket.
7. Within a player's bucket, if more than one effect is pending, create chooseTriggerOrder for that player.
8. If no choice is required, use stable tie-breakers: createdAtEventSeq, then source instance id, then effect id.
```

Consequences:

- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are pending, and A creates turn player effect C while resolving, B resolves before C.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage points are complete, except `[Trigger]` resolution itself.
- Effects triggered during an effect or card activation wait until the triggering process completes.
- Optional triggered effects create `chooseOptionalActivation` decisions at the point they would enter or begin resolution, according to the card's timing rule.

## Queue processing

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s010 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s010`

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

Generic composed execution is represented by a resumable effect execution frame stored in `GameState.effectExecutionFrames`. The frame is serialized authoritative runtime context for one resolving effect and is not a client-facing object. It must track at least the queue entry, effect block, current effect path, next segment index, saved result references, segment results, transient selection sets, and pending-decision continuation. Frame records participate in authoritative canonical serialization and state hashes, but filtered player and live spectator views must not expose frame internals.

When a sequence segment pauses for a `PendingDecision`, the runtime stores the frame and returns the pending decision with the same causality context. After a valid response, resolution resumes from the stored frame at the paused segment rather than restarting earlier segments. Completed earlier segments must not be re-applied, and their saved result references and segment results remain available for later connector decisions.

## Conditions and costs

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s011 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s011`

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

wrapper or entry-point adapter responsibilities are timing window selection, legal-action exposure or queueing, source-presence policy selection, once-per-turn marker handling, and activation commitment semantics. wrapper semantics are distinct from reusable effect body primitive semantics.

Optionality has three distinct meanings:

- Optional activation asks whether the player commits to resolving the effect block. Declining optional activation means the effect block is not legally committed and once-per-turn usage is not consumed.
- Optional cost asks whether the player pays a non-mandatory cost inside an otherwise committed effect. Declining or failing an optional cost records `paidCost: false` and only skips later instructions whose connector or text depends on that cost being paid.
- Optional effect clause asks whether the player performs a non-mandatory instruction during resolution. Declining an optional effect clause records `playerDeclined: true` for that segment and does not undo prior legally completed segments.

Optional cost clauses inside composed execution are not effect-block activation
costs. They occur after legal commitment to the effect block, inside a
resumable sequence segment. Optional cost accept, decline, and failure do not
consume once-per-turn usage because usage was consumed at legal commitment
before the optional cost clause executes. Accepted optional costs pay cost
atomically and emit the normal cost-payment events. Declined optional costs do
not emit cost-payment events. Failed optional costs emit no public event that
reveals hidden payment candidates or private payment details.

Accepted optional cost records `attempted: true`, `succeeded: true`,
`paidCost: true`, and `playerDeclined: false`; `changedState` records whether
canonical state actually changed. Declined optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: true`. Failed optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: false`. Optional cost accept, decline,
and failure do not consume once-per-turn usage, and dependent connectors use
`paidCost` rather than optional-activation state.
Event `seq` values and `state.seq` advancement remain deterministic for
optional cost accept, decline, and failure. State hashes include the frame
segment result for each branch.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

## Player choices during effect resolution

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s012 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s012`

Effects pause through `PendingDecision`.

Example target selection flow:

```ts
function executeKoEffect(
  state: GameState,
  effect: KoEffect,
  context: EffectContext,
): EngineResult {
  const candidates = resolveTargetCandidates(state, effect.target, context);

  if (requiresChoice(effect.target)) {
    return pauseForDecision(state, {
      type: "selectTargets",
      playerId: resolveChooser(effect.target, context),
      request: effect.target,
      candidates,
      causedBy: context.causedBy,
    });
  }

  return koTargets(state, candidates.selected, context);
}
```

Decision responses are validated by the engine, not the client.

Composed execution records one segment result for every attempted sequence segment or optional clause. A segment result must record `attempted`, `succeeded`, `changedState`, `selectedCards`, `selectedTargets`, `paidCost`, and `playerDeclined`. `succeeded` means the segment legally performed its required instruction, while `changedState` separately records whether canonical state changed. Legal selection without mutation may still drive connectors such as "if you do" when card text depends on choosing or identifying an object.

Saved-result references may bind selected cards, selected targets, paid costs, or produced objects for later text such as `that Character`. A later segment may use a saved-result reference only while the referenced object remains legal for that later instruction; otherwise the later segment follows its connector and failure policy. Saved references must preserve hidden-information visibility and replay determinism.

A saved field-object reference is the runtime contract for same-frame `selectedTargets` and `producedObjects` consumers in the same effect execution frame. `selectedTargets` production records the public field objects legally selected by a non-mutating `selectTargets` request segment in the segment result and saved-reference ledger; mutating target effects are not standalone selectedTargets producer authority. `producedObjects` records public field objects produced by a supported segment when runtime work for that producer explicitly authorizes the produced-object family. Saved hand-selection/playSelected references remain separate from saved field-object references and must not be consumed as field-object targets.

Field-object consumers must validate the saved family, `saveResultAs`, optional object index, current zone, player/controller, filter, public visibility, and instruction legality at consumption time. unsupported saved-reference families fail closed. stale objects, gone objects, hidden objects, and illegal objects fail closed. A fail-closed saved field-object reference records the segment as attempted, not succeeded, and not changedState, then follows the active connector and failure policy. Public events, public legal actions, PlayerView, and SpectatorView must not reveal hidden identities, hidden candidates, or the private saved-reference failure reason; replay and private effect logs may retain the failure reason for audit. State hashes include the frame saved-reference ledger, the consumer result, and unchanged public/hidden game state so replay, event order, and connector decisions remain deterministic.

Accepted optional cost records `attempted: true`, `succeeded: true`,
`paidCost: true`, and `playerDeclined: false`. Declined optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: true`. Failed optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: false`. Optional cost accept, decline,
and failure do not consume once-per-turn usage.

Optional cost segment results participate in the serialized effect execution
frame and authoritative state hash. Event `seq` values and `state.seq`
advancement remain deterministic for accepted, declined, and failed optional
cost branches under `03-game-state-events-decisions.s005` and
`03-game-state-events-decisions.s022`: resolving a valid optional-cost decision
advances `state.seq` once, individual internal events do not each advance
`state.seq`, and rejected stale, malformed, wrong-player, or insufficient
payment responses do not resolve the decision. State hashes include the frame
segment result and unchanged game state for decline or failure branches.

## Replacement effects

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s013 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s013`

Replacement effects intercept replaceable processes.

```ts
interface ReplacementProcess {
  id: string;
  type: ReplaceableProcessType;
  source?: CardRef;
  target?: CardRef;
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  usedReplacementIds: string[];
}
```

Processing order:

1. Replacements generated by the card/process being replaced, if applicable.
2. Turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.
3. Non-turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.

A replacement cannot apply twice to the same replacement process. If a replacement cannot actually perform its replacement, it does not apply.

```ts
function executeReplaceableProcess(
  state: GameState,
  process: ReplacementProcess,
): EngineStepResult {
  let current = process;
  let currentState = state;

  while (true) {
    const replacements = findApplicableReplacements(currentState, current)
      .filter((r) => !current.usedReplacementIds.includes(r.id))
      .filter((r) => canApplyReplacement(r, currentState, current));

    if (replacements.length === 0) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    const choice = chooseReplacementByPriorityOrDecision(
      currentState,
      replacements,
      current,
    );

    if (choice.pausedForDecision) {
      return choice.result;
    }

    if (!choice.chosen) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    current = {
      ...transformProcessByReplacement(choice.chosen, currentState, current),
      usedReplacementIds: [...current.usedReplacementIds, choice.chosen.id],
    };

    currentState = emitReplacementApplied(
      currentState,
      choice.chosen,
      current,
    ).state;
  }
}
```

Replacement decisions use `PendingDecision.chooseReplacement`. Optional replacements may be declined; mandatory replacements cannot be declined unless more than one mandatory replacement requires a controller-chosen order. A replacement cannot apply twice to the same `process.id`, even if the process is transformed into a new shape.

Every applied replacement emits `replacementApplied` with the original process ID, selected replacement ID, old process payload hash, and transformed process payload hash. This event is at least `replayOnly` and may be public when the replacement effect is public.

## Continuous effects as computed view

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s014 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s014`

Continuous and permanent effects do not mutate canonical state on every recalculation. They generate modifiers, and a computed view applies them.

```ts
interface ContinuousEffectRecord {
  id: string;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  controller: PlayerId;
  modifier: Modifier;
  duration: Duration;
  condition?: Condition;
  createdBy: CausalityRef;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

interface Modifier {
  layer: ModifierLayer;
  target: TargetSpec;
  operation: ModifierOperation;
}

type ModifierLayer =
  | "basePowerSet"
  | "baseCostSet"
  | "powerAdd"
  | "costAdd"
  | "keywordAdd"
  | "keywordRemove"
  | "restriction"
  | "protection";
```

Computing a view:

```ts
function computeView(state: GameState): ComputedGameView {
  const base = buildBaseView(state);
  const activeModifiers = collectActiveContinuousEffects(state);
  return applyModifierLayers(base, activeModifiers, state.turn.turnPlayerId);
}
```

Permanent effects may depend on the computed state. If the official rule requires fixed-point behavior, implement the fixed-point over computed views, not by writing current power/cost into canonical state.

exact-card continuous-effect target binding uses `TargetSpec` shape `{ type: "exactCard"; card: CardRef; binding: SavedFieldObjectTargetBinding; createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq }`. A duration-bearing modifier created from a chosen target resolves the saved field-object reference once, stores the exact card target in the `ContinuousEffectRecord`, and does not re-run the original `choose` target during computed-view recalculation. The modifier remains bound to the same card instance while that instance remains legal for the modifier and the duration; if the object is stale, gone, hidden, or illegal, the modifier fails closed without leaking hidden identities.

## Duration expiration

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s015 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s015`

| Duration               | Expiration point                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `thisBattle`           | End of Battle                                                 |
| `thisTurn`             | End Phase cleanup                                             |
| `untilEndOfTurn`       | End Phase cleanup                                             |
| `untilStartOfNextTurn` | Start of specified player's next Refresh Phase                |
| `whileSourceOnField`   | When source leaves required zone                              |
| `whileConditionTrue`   | Not active when condition false; removed or ignored by policy |
| `permanent`            | Only for true game-permanent changes; avoid for field buffs   |

## Failure policy

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s016 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s016`

```ts
type FailurePolicy =
  | "doAsMuchAsPossible"
  | "requiresAll"
  | "skipIfNoLegalTarget"
  | "optionalIfPossible";
```

Default is `doAsMuchAsPossible`, unless a connector or card text requires dependency.

For composed execution, failure policy applies to the whole effect block and to each segment through its connector:

- `doAsMuchAsPossible` attempts each supported segment and records per-segment success without rolling back successful independent segments.
- `requiresAll` fails the composed execution before mutation when any required segment cannot legally complete.
- `skipIfNoLegalTarget` skips the composed execution when required activation-time or first required resolution-time targets are absent.
- `optionalIfPossible` offers the optional instruction only when at least one legal execution path exists; if none exists, the segment is not attempted and does not create a decision.

Unsupported composed runtime shapes default to fail-closed rather than degrading to partial execution. Ambiguous connector dependency, saved-reference lifetime, optionality boundary, target visibility, pending-decision continuation, or replacement interaction must be treated as unsupported until the spec and capability matrix authorize it.

Exact wrapper-body allowlists are insufficient generated-support evidence unless they also expose required primitive-boundary evidence. A supported effect body under one entry point does not authorize support under another entry point; support under another entry point requires separate entry-point adapter evidence plus body or composition evidence.

## Transient reveal and selection sets

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s017 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s017`

Transient sets are part of effect execution context, not normal zones. They exist for patterns such as revealing the top card, selecting from a revealed set, and returning unselected cards face-down.

Rules:

1. A transient set has an origin, visibility, and cleanup policy.
2. Cards in a transient set are not simultaneously in hand/deck/trash/life.
3. Movement from a transient set to a real zone must emit a `cardMoved` event with appropriate visibility.
4. If an effect exits early, cleanup policy runs before the queue continues.
5. Opponent views may see a revealed card only for the duration and visibility specified by the effect. If the card returns face-down to a hidden zone, future opponent views must not retain its ID.

## Custom handlers

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s018 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s018`

Custom handlers are an escape hatch, not a shortcut.

Use a custom handler when:

- The effect needs state tracking not represented by DSL primitives.
- The effect modifies core rules.
- The effect has complex nested choices that would make the DSL unreadable.
- A new DSL primitive would be premature for a one-off effect.

Handlers must be pure, immutable, deterministic, and test-covered.

```ts
interface CustomHandler {
  id: string;
  cardId: CardId;
  effectId: string;
  execute(state: GameState, context: EffectContext): EngineResult;
}
```

If several handlers repeat the same logic, promote that behavior into a DSL primitive.

## Effect logging

<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s019 -->

Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s019`

For replay, log:

- Triggering player action.
- Public and private decisions/responses.
- Random choices/shuffles by RNG call count.
- Effect IDs queued/resolved/cancelled.
- State hashes at checkpoints.
