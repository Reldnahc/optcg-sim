# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-036C
Epic ID: KICK-001
Title: Extract trigger category queueing helpers
Type: refactor
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Extract On Play, attacking, opponent-attack, K.O., and effect-resolved trigger queueing helper bodies from effect-runtime-trigger-queueing.ts into focused modules without changing queue entries, lifecycle events, errors, ordering, state hashes, or visibility.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 04-effect-runtime.s006 (Effect queue entry)

```ts
interface EffectQueueEntry {
  id: QueueEntryId;
  state: "pending" | "resolving" | "resolved" | "cancelled";
  timingWindowId: TimingWindowId;
  generation: number;
  controllerId: PlayerId;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  triggerEventId?: EngineEventId;
  effectBlockId: EffectId;
  orderingGroup: "turnPlayer" | "nonTurnPlayer";
  createdAtEventSeq: number;
  queuedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  sourcePresencePolicy: SourcePresencePolicy;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s007 (Source presence policy)

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

### 04-effect-runtime.s008 (Trigger detection from events)

Trigger detection consumes event batches.

```ts
function detectTriggeredEffects(
  state: GameState,
  events: EngineEvent[],
): TriggerCandidate[] {
  const candidates: TriggerCandidate[] = [];

  for (const event of events) {
    candidates.push(...findAutoEffectsForEvent(state, event));
    candidates.push(...findReplacementFollowupsIfAny(state, event));
  }

  return candidates.filter((c) => canTriggerNow(c, state));
}
```

The engine must check source presence before queueing, then apply the queue entry's source-presence policy before resolution.

### 04-effect-runtime.s016 (Failure policy)

```ts
type FailurePolicy =
  | "doAsMuchAsPossible"
  | "requiresAll"
  | "skipIfNoLegalTarget"
  | "optionalIfPossible";
```

Default is `doAsMuchAsPossible`, unless a connector or card text requires dependency.

### 06-visibility-security.s006 (Effect event visibility)

The game log can leak information if not filtered.

```ts
interface EffectEvent {
  id: string;
  sourceCardId: CardId;
  sourceInstanceId?: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  description: string;
  choices?: PublicChoiceSummary;
  visibleTo: "both" | PlayerId[] | "replayOnly";
}
```

Examples:

- Public target selection: visible to both.
- Searching deck: opponent sees "Opponent is searching deck" and maybe count, not card IDs.
- Choosing a card from hand to trash: opponent sees the resulting public trash card, not pre-choice hand options.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Package-boundary enforcement is required, not optional.

At minimum, lint rules or dependency-cruiser / equivalent boundary tooling must enforce:

- `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.
- `@optcg/view-engine` cannot import hidden-information-only server modules.
- `@optcg/client` cannot import server-only packages.
- `@optcg/server` cannot bypass `@optcg/cards` to call card-data sources directly from engine execution paths.
- test helpers that expose hidden state cannot be imported into browser/client production bundles.
- replay validation code cannot depend on client rendering code.

If stronger tooling is adopted, such as dependency-cruiser, Knip, or custom graph checks, CI must fail on violations.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

A pull request must not merge unless the main CI pipeline passes.

Minimum required merge gates:

1. install dependencies with locked versions,
2. build/typecheck workspace,
3. lint workspace,
4. run tests,
5. validate contracts and schemas,
6. validate formatting,
7. publish coverage artifact,
8. fail if generated artifacts or snapshots are stale when the repo defines them.

Recommended CI jobs:

- `quality` -> lint, typecheck, format check
- `engine` -> engine unit, interaction, invariant, replay tests
- `contracts` -> canonical types, DSL schema, fixture normalization, SQL/schema validation
- `client-server-smoke` -> protocol smoke tests and filtered-view checks

For protected branches, require at least one human review plus passing CI.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only behavior-preserving production helper extraction for trigger category queueing bodies after source lookup helpers have been split. Do not alter trigger semantics or supported effect definitions.

## Scope

- move On Play queueing logic into effect-runtime-trigger-queueing-on-play.ts with identical error and event behavior
- move When Attacking and On Your Opponent's Attack queueing logic into effect-runtime-trigger-queueing-attack.ts with identical stale-zone and source-presence handling
- move Battle K.O. candidate detection, K.O. queueing, and effect-resolved custom trigger queueing into effect-runtime-trigger-queueing-ko.ts with identical ordering and metadata behavior
- keep createEffectRuntimeTriggerQueueing and exported compatibility surface stable in effect-runtime-trigger-queueing.ts

## Out of Scope

- changing supported trigger categories or supported primitive shape checks
- changing source lookup behavior beyond imports from ENG-036B helpers
- changing queue processing, effect primitive execution, or trigger-order behavior
- changing event payloads, error details, state hashes, or visibility

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-036C packet while implementing this story
- target the ENG-036 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- this is a behavior-preserving production refactor story; if any behavior delta appears, stop and split or record an ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime-trigger-queueing-on-play.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime-trigger-queueing-attack.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime-trigger-queueing-ko.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime-trigger-queueing-source-presence.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime-ko-triggers.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime-queue-processing.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- focused trigger category modules own the existing category queueing logic
- effect-runtime-trigger-queueing.ts remains behavior-compatible for createEffectRuntimeTriggerQueueing consumers
- no event, error, queue entry, state hash, ordering, or hidden-information output changes
- focused trigger queueing tests, coverage, and full verify pass

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
