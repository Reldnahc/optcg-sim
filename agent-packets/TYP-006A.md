## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s003 (Base state vs. computed view)

Separate base facts from derived values.

Base state stores:

- Which cards are in which zones.
- Active/rested state.
- Attached DON!! cards.
- Turn, phase, battle sub-step.
- Effect durations and source references.
- Pending decisions.

Computed view derives:

- Current power.
- Current cost.
- Granted/removed keywords.
- Attack/block restrictions.
- Protection from K.O. or other processes.
- Replacement candidates.

```ts
interface ComputedGameView {
  seq: StateSeq;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  cards: Record<InstanceId, ComputedCardView>;
  legalAttackTargets: Record<InstanceId, InstanceId[]>;
  restrictions: RestrictionIndex;
}

interface ComputedCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  basePower?: number;
  currentPower?: number;
  baseCost?: number;
  currentCost?: number;
  keywords: Keyword[];
  canAttack: boolean;
  canBlock: boolean;
  cannotBeAttacked: boolean;
  protectedFrom: Protection[];
}
```

Do not persist derived current power as canonical state unless a rule explicitly changes a base value. Recompute from base state and continuous modifiers.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s016 (Action envelope inside the engine)

The server-facing protocol envelope is defined separately. The engine action should be pure data.

```ts
type Action =
  | { type: "playCard"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; costPayment?: PaymentSpec }
  | {
      type: "activateEffect";
      source: CardRef;
      effectId: string;
      costPayment?: PaymentSpec;
    }
  | { type: "attachDon"; donInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | {
      type: "respondToDecision";
      decisionId: string;
      response: DecisionResponse;
    };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 06-visibility-security.s004 (PlayerView shape)

```ts
interface PlayerView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  self: VisiblePlayerState;
  opponent: OpponentVisibleState;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PublicDecision;
  legalActions: PublicLegalAction[];
  revealedCards: PublicRevealRecord[];
  events: EngineEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Do not include:

- Deck order.
- Opponent hand card IDs.
- Face-down life card IDs.
- RNG seed/internal state.
- Effect queue internals.
- Private decision candidates not visible to recipient.
- Internal crash/recovery metadata.

Canonical public support DTOs for the initial live view contract:

```ts
type SpectatorPolicy = {
  mode: "disabled" | "live-filtered";
  allowHandRevealAfterGame: boolean;
};

interface PublicTurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}

interface PublicBattleState {
  attacker: CardRef;
  originalTarget: CardRef;
  currentTarget: CardRef;
  blocker?: CardRef;
  step: BattleStep;
  damageCount: number;
}

interface PublicCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  attachedDonCount: number;
  turnPlayed?: number;
}

interface PublicLifeView {
  count: number;
  faceUpCards: PublicCardView[];
}

interface VisiblePlayerState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  hand: PublicCardView[];
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

interface OpponentVisibleState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  handCount: number;
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

type SpectatorVisiblePlayerState = OpponentVisibleState;

interface PublicDecision {
  id: DecisionId;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

type PublicLegalAction =
  | { type: "playCard"; card: CardRef; costPaymentRequired?: boolean }
  | { type: "activateEffect"; source: CardRef; effectId: EffectId }
  | { type: "attachDon"; don: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; card: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "respondToDecision"; decisionId: DecisionId };

interface PublicRevealRecord {
  id: string;
  cards: CardRef[];
  visibility: "public" | "privateToRecipient";
  origin: ZoneRef | "topOfDeck" | "lifeDamage" | "custom";
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  cleanupPolicy: "returnToOrigin" | "trashAfterResolution" | "none";
}

type SpectatorRevealRecord = Omit<PublicRevealRecord, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: "public";
};

type SpectatorEvent = Omit<EngineEvent, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: { type: "public" };
};
```

Initial live-filtered spectator view is distinct from `PlayerView`:

```ts
interface SpectatorView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  spectatorPolicy: SpectatorPolicy;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, SpectatorVisiblePlayerState>;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  revealedCards: SpectatorRevealRecord[];
  events: SpectatorEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Initial `SpectatorView` has no `pendingDecision` or `legalActions` field.
It does not include either player's hand card IDs, deck order, face-down life
card IDs, private reveal records, non-public events, RNG state, effect queue
internals, or audit entries. Full-information live spectating is deferred to a
future explicit policy story.

### 06-visibility-security.s007 (Legal-action visibility)

Legal actions can leak hidden information. The view should expose only what that recipient is entitled to know.

Examples:

- The defender should not see exactly why the server auto-passed the counter window.
- A player may see their own legal counter cards.
- The opponent sees only that the game progressed, not whether no counters existed or auto-pass was enabled.

### 06-visibility-security.s017 (Filter checklist)

Before any state leaves the server:

```ts
assertNoDeckContents(view);
assertNoOpponentHandContents(view);
assertNoFaceDownLifeContents(view);
assertNoRngState(view);
assertNoEffectQueueInternals(view);
assertNoPrivateDecisionCandidates(view);
assertRevealRecordsAreRecipientFiltered(view);
assertLegalActionsDoNotLeakOpponentHiddenInfo(view);
assertSpectatorPolicyApplied(view);
```

Run these in tests for every `PlayerView` fixture.

### 06-visibility-security.s021 (Original state-filtering categories preserved)

The mechanical spec separated visibility into multiple view categories. The implementation should keep separate filters rather than one generic serializer.

| View                   | Purpose                      | Hidden-info policy                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PlayerView`           | Active player UI             | Own hand visible; opponent hidden zones counted only.                              |
| `SpectatorView`        | Spectator UI                 | Initial `live-filtered` mode shows public board/zones and hidden-zone counts only. |
| `ReplayView`           | Completed replay             | Can show full state after match completion, subject to replay visibility policy.   |
| Temporary reveal view  | Resolving effects            | Shows only currently revealed cards to allowed recipients.                         |
| Battle-specific view   | Attack/block/counter windows | Shows battle context without leaking opponent counters unless revealed.            |
| Effect-resolution view | Search/look/choice prompts   | Private candidates visible only to choosing player unless effect says reveal.      |

### 22-v6-implementation-tightening.s006 (2. TypeScript model)

The old `16-typescript-interface-draft.md` was a draft and referenced undefined symbols. The implementation contract is now `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

Resolved and normalized items include:

- `Color` -> `CardColor`
- `Attribute`
- `ZoneRef`
- `MatchCardManifest`
- `RngState`
- `EffectQueueEntry`
- `ContinuousEffect`
- `EventVisibility`
- `CardRef`
- `DecisionResponse`
- `Cost`
- `PaymentOption`
- `TargetRequest`
- `CardSelectionRequest`
- `EffectOption`
- `PublicEffectEvent` replacement via filtered `EngineEvent[]`
- `PlayerView` and initial live-filtered `SpectatorView`
- public live-view DTO support contracts
- spectator-safe public-only reveal and event DTOs
- `eventLog`/`eventJournal` conflict resolved to `eventJournal`
- `activeBattle`/`battle` conflict resolved to `battle`
- serializable arrays instead of `Set`

The contract compiles with:

```bash
cd contracts
tsc -p tsconfig.json
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only filterStateForPlayer public PlayerView DTO projection and focused tests for undeclared public fields. Stop before changing replacement routing, compute-view semantics, client protocol behavior, replay behavior, or the wider view model.

## Scope

- inspect current filterStateForPlayer runtime output for `PublicCardView.currentPower`, `pendingDecision.processId`, `pendingDecision.replacementIds`, and `pendingDecision.mandatory`
- keep `currentPower` out of public `PublicCardView` projection unless canonical `PlayerView` authority explicitly adds it
- keep replacement-process routing fields out of public `PublicDecision` projection while the TYP-005C ambiguity record says visibility semantics are unresolved
- add or tighten focused tests so emitted PlayerView JSON and canonical DTO field sets agree for board card views and chooseReplacement pending decisions
- update the existing ambiguity record only if needed to clarify that runtime projection is fail-closed while the replacement-decision visibility question remains unresolved

## Out of Scope

- adding new canonical DTO fields without explicit spec authority
- changing `contracts/types/*` or `packages/types/src/*` unless canonical authority is found and this story is split or revised first
- changing replacement-effect routing, decision response semantics, compute-view power calculation, legal-action generation, server protocol payloads, client UI, replay behavior, or gameplay rules
- broad hidden-information test reorganization

## Allowed Touch Points

- packages/engine-core/src/filter-state-for-player.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/filter-state-for-player.test.ts
- stories/ambiguities/TYP-005C-canonical-package-migration-downstream-consumers.md

- stories/approved/TYP-006A-filter-state-player-view-canonical-dto-guard.yaml
- agent-packets/TYP-006A.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- use TDD for any production behavior change
- fail closed on hidden-information or replacement-decision visibility ambiguity
- do not broaden this story to redesign view DTOs, replacement decisions, compute-view, protocol, client, replay, or gameplay behavior
- if specs authorize a field as public, stop and split a canonical contract story before adding it
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- run `corepack pnpm run packets:generate --story stories/approved/TYP-006A-filter-state-player-view-canonical-dto-guard.yaml --activate`
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`
- run `corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/filter-state-for-player.test.ts`
- run `corepack pnpm exec vitest run tests/hidden-info`
- run `corepack pnpm run contracts`
- run `corepack pnpm run verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- runtime `filterStateForPlayer` output does not contain undeclared public DTO fields from the inspected field set
- canonical `PublicCardView` and `PublicDecision` types match the emitted PlayerView JSON shape for the inspected fields
- replacement-decision routing metadata remains internal or ambiguity-gated, not silently public
- hidden-information safety is preserved for the focused PlayerView paths
