## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s035 (Exact win/loss conditions)

Run defeat checks at every rule-processing checkpoint:

1. **Leader damage at 0 Life** - if a player has 0 Life cards and their Leader would take damage, that player loses.
2. **Deck-out** - if a player has 0 cards in deck at any rule-processing checkpoint, that player loses.
3. **Concession** - a player may concede at any time; concession is immediate and cannot be prevented or replaced by card effects.
4. **Effect-based win/loss** - card effects may directly cause a win or loss during effect resolution.
5. **Double loss** - if both players meet defeat conditions at the same rule-processing checkpoint, both lose and the match is a draw.

Rule processing happens after atomic state changes, including mid-effect. For example, if a player decks out while drawing during an effect, the loss is detected at the next rule-processing point.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseQuantity
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

For `chooseQuantity`, the response payload shape is `{ type: "chooseQuantity"; quantity: number }`. The outer `respondToDecision.decisionId` must name the active `chooseQuantity` decision. The inner `ChooseQuantityResponse` payload does not carry a decision ID; it is valid only when it has response type `chooseQuantity` and carries a whole integer `quantity` inside the decision's allowed `min` and `max` bounds.

Cardinality is explicit:

- exact-N decisions use `mode: "exact"` and must be represented with `min: N` and `max: N`; `mode: "exact"` with different `min` and `max` values is malformed and must not be created. A response below the required value, above it, non-integer, negative when the minimum is non-negative, or otherwise out-of-range is an `invalidDecisionResponse`.
- up-to-N decisions use `mode: "upTo"` and allow a partial response from `min` through `max`, inclusive. Choosing `max` is legal. Choosing less than `max` is legal only when it is still at least `min`.
- zero is legal only when the decision's `min` is `0`; exact-0 is represented as `min: 0`, `max: 0`, and `mode: "exact"`.
- minimum and maximum bounds are authoritative. Responses below `min`, above `max`, non-integer, missing, or with the wrong response type are rejected as `invalidDecisionResponse`.

Quantity decisions exposed through legal actions must advertise only public bounds, prompt text, and the active decision ID. They must not reveal hidden candidate counts, must not reveal hidden card identities, and must not encode whether a private candidate set contains a particular card. If a quantity is constrained by hidden information, the engine validates against the private candidate set internally and returns `invalidDecisionResponse` for illegal responses without disclosing the hidden reason through public legal actions or public events.

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s022 (Internal state sequencing)

```ts
type StateSeq = number & { __brand: "StateSeq" };

interface TurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}
```

Increment `state.seq` after every accepted action or resolved decision, not after every internal event. Internal events have their own sequence inside the event journal.

### 04-effect-runtime.s012 (Player choices during effect resolution)

Effects pause through `PendingDecision`.

Example target selection flow:

```ts
function executeKoEffect(
  state: GameState,
  effect: KoEffect,
  context: EffectContext,
): EngineResult {
  const candidates = resolveTargetCandidates(state, effect.target, context);

  if (requiresChoice(effect.target)) {
    return pauseForDecision(state, {
      type: "selectTargets",
      playerId: resolveChooser(effect.target, context),
      request: effect.target,
      candidates,
      causedBy: context.causedBy,
    });
  }

  return koTargets(state, candidates.selected, context);
}
```

Decision responses are validated by the engine, not the client.

Composed execution records one segment result for every attempted sequence segment or optional clause. A segment result must record `attempted`, `succeeded`, `changedState`, `selectedCards`, `selectedTargets`, `paidCost`, and `playerDeclined`. `succeeded` means the segment legally performed its required instruction, while `changedState` separately records whether canonical state changed. Legal selection without mutation may still drive connectors such as "if you do" when card text depends on choosing or identifying an object.

Saved-result references may bind selected cards, selected targets, paid costs, or produced objects for later text such as `that Character`. A later segment may use a saved-result reference only while the referenced object remains legal for that later instruction; otherwise the later segment follows its connector and failure policy. Saved references must preserve hidden-information visibility and replay determinism.

### 04-effect-runtime.s016 (Failure policy)

```ts
type FailurePolicy =
  | "doAsMuchAsPossible"
  | "requiresAll"
  | "skipIfNoLegalTarget"
  | "optionalIfPossible";
```

Default is `doAsMuchAsPossible`, unless a connector or card text requires dependency.

For composed execution, failure policy applies to the whole effect block and to each segment through its connector:

- `doAsMuchAsPossible` attempts each supported segment and records per-segment success without rolling back successful independent segments.
- `requiresAll` fails the composed execution before mutation when any required segment cannot legally complete.
- `skipIfNoLegalTarget` skips the composed execution when required activation-time or first required resolution-time targets are absent.
- `optionalIfPossible` offers the optional instruction only when at least one legal execution path exists; if none exists, the segment is not attempted and does not create a decision.

Unsupported composed runtime shapes default to fail-closed rather than degrading to partial execution. Ambiguous connector dependency, saved-reference lifetime, optionality boundary, target visibility, pending-decision continuation, or replacement interaction must be treated as unsupported until the spec and capability matrix authorize it.

### 04-effect-runtime.s019 (Effect logging)

For replay, log:

- Triggering player action.
- Public and private decisions/responses.
- Random choices/shuffles by RNG call count.
- Effect IDs queued/resolved/cancelled.
- State hashes at checkpoints.

Do not rely on transient JavaScript function behavior for replay. Custom handler versions must be part of `effectDefinitionsVersion` or their own handler version manifest.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s012 (Effects)

```

Cardinality fields such as `min` and `max` use the exact-N and up-to-N semantics from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`. `drawUpTo` is a planned `chooseQuantity`-backed primitive: it must pause through a `chooseQuantity` pending decision, validate the selected whole integer against public min/max bounds, and draw only the chosen amount when a future runtime story makes it executable.

`drawUpTo` short-deck resolution is do-as-much-as-possible. If the chosen quantity is greater than the number of cards remaining in that player's deck, the runtime must draw every remaining card and emit draw and card-movement events only for cards actually drawn. The next rule-processing checkpoint detects deck-out under `02-engine-mechanics.s035`; the effect does not fail closed before drawing the remaining cards solely because the chosen quantity exceeded the remaining deck size.

Event `seq` values for partial-deck drawUpTo resolution must remain strictly increasing by append order, as required by `03-game-state-events-decisions.s005`. The resolved decision increments `state.seq` once under `03-game-state-events-decisions.s022`; individual draw events do not each advance `state.seq`. State hashes at the replay checkpoints include the post-draw empty deck. Golden replay coverage for drawUpTo short-deck cases must pin the final state hash.

Duration and restriction effects such as `cannotAttack`, `cannotBlock`, `cannotBeAttacked`, `cannotBeBlockedBy`, `invalidateEffects`, and `protectFromKO` remain planned unless the schema coverage policy lists them as schema-supported and the runtime capability matrix proves the active engine can enforce the restriction for the full duration.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 11-testing-quality.s010 (Golden replay tests)

Store known game scripts and final state hashes.

```text
fixtures/replays/
  vanilla-basic-game.json
  blocker-counter-basic.json
  double-attack-life-trigger.json
  simultaneous-ko-triggers.json
  replacement-trigger-trash.json
```

CI replays them and checks:

- Final state hash.
- Checkpoint hashes.
- Event count/type sequence, optionally.
- No hidden-info leak in generated views.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only specification authority, generated spec metadata, and narrow authority tests for drawUpTo short-deck runtime semantics. Do not change engine runtime code, canonical type files, effect DSL schema, parser behavior, generated support, fixtures, or gameplay implementation.

## Scope

- clarify that drawUpTo remains chooseQuantity-backed and draws no more than the chosen quantity
- clarify what happens when the chosen quantity is greater than the number of cards remaining in deck
- clarify whether the runtime draws all remaining cards before the next rule-processing deck-out check, or fails closed instead
- clarify event-order and state-sequence expectations for partial-deck drawUpTo resolution
- clarify replay and state-hash authority for drawUpTo short-deck cases
- add or update authority tests that pin the new drawUpTo short-deck wording
- update generated spec metadata

## Out of Scope

- engine runtime implementation
- canonical type changes or effect DSL schema changes
- parser certification, generated-support admission, real-card fixtures, support reports, server/client/API/UI/database work
- general draw behavior unrelated to drawUpTo
- replacement generalization

## Allowed Touch Points

- agent-packets/SPEC-009A.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- do not implement runtime behavior in this story
- do not broaden into unrelated draw or deck-out behavior
- fail closed on gameplay, replay, hidden-information, event-order, or state-hash ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- update `tests/contracts/spec-authority-gates.test.mjs` to require drawUpTo short-deck, partial-deck, replay, and state-hash authority wording
- run `corepack pnpm run specs:generate-metadata`
- run `corepack pnpm run specs:verify-metadata`
- run `corepack pnpm run test:contracts`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- run `corepack pnpm run verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- specs explicitly define drawUpTo short-deck behavior for chosen quantities greater than remaining deck size
- specs explicitly bind drawUpTo short-deck behavior to deck-out timing or fail-closed behavior
- specs provide stable authority for deterministic event order, replay, and state-hash expectations for drawUpTo short-deck cases
- authority tests pin the clarified drawUpTo short-deck wording
- ENG-055H can cite the clarified sections without inventing runtime behavior
