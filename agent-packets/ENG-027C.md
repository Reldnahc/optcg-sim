## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s041 (Auto-effect timing details)

- `[When Attacking]` and `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` are distinct timing windows.
- The attacker's `[When Attacking]` effects trigger first.
- Defender's `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` effects trigger after that window.
- `[On K.O.]` activates on field but resolves from trash.
- `[DON!! xX]` triggers or becomes active when attached DON!! count goes from below X to at least X, depending on whether the specific effect is auto or permanent.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 04-effect-runtime.s006 (Effect queue entry)

```ts
interface EffectQueueEntry {
  id: QueueEntryId;
  state: "pending" | "resolving" | "resolved" | "cancelled";
  timingWindowId: TimingWindowId;
  generation: number;
  controllerId: PlayerId;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  triggerEventId?: EngineEventId;
  effectBlockId: EffectId;
  orderingGroup: "turnPlayer" | "nonTurnPlayer";
  createdAtEventSeq: number;
  queuedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  sourcePresencePolicy: SourcePresencePolicy;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s007 (Source presence policy)

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

### 04-effect-runtime.s009 (Queue ordering)

Every trigger collection creates or joins a timing window. Queue order is deterministic and must not depend on JavaScript array discovery order except where the spec explicitly says discovery order is the canonical tie-breaker.

Normative ordering algorithm:

```text
1. Assign every collected trigger a timingWindowId.
2. Assign generation = 0 for effects triggered by the original timing event.
3. When resolving an effect produces new triggers, enqueue them with generation = currentGeneration + 1 in the same timing window unless a new official timing window has opened.
4. Resolve older timing windows before newer timing windows.
5. Within a timing window, resolve lower generation before higher generation.
6. Within a generation, resolve turn-player bucket before non-turn-player bucket.
7. Within a player's bucket, if more than one effect is pending, create chooseTriggerOrder for that player.
8. If no choice is required, use stable tie-breakers: createdAtEventSeq, then source instance id, then effect id.
```

Consequences:

- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are pending, and A creates turn player effect C while resolving, B resolves before C.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage points are complete, except `[Trigger]` resolution itself.
- Effects triggered during an effect or card activation wait until the triggering process completes.
- Optional triggered effects create `chooseOptionalActivation` decisions at the point they would enter or begin resolution, according to the card's timing rule.

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s005 (Triggers)

type Trigger =

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s029 (Schema coverage policy)

`contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` is the executable JSON fixture contract.
TypeScript/spec primitives outside that JSON schema are planned/not
fixture-authorable until schema validation and fixtures exist.

Schema-supported fixture subset:

- trigger: onPlay
- trigger: whenAttacking
- trigger: onOpponentAttack
- trigger: onBlock
- trigger: onKO
- trigger: endOfYourTurn
- trigger: endOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: trigger
- trigger: activateMain
- trigger: main
- trigger: counter
- trigger: permanent
- trigger: startOfGame
- trigger: startOfYourTurn
- trigger: startOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: startOfMainPhase
- trigger: endOfBattle
- trigger: donAttach
- trigger: custom
- condition: yourTurn
- condition: attachedDonCount
- cost: restDon
- cost: restSelf
- cost: sequence
- target: self, myLeader, opponentLeader, attacker, attackTarget, blocker,
  triggerCard, all, choose
- duration: thisAction, thisBattle, thisTurn, whileSourceOnField, permanent
- effect: draw
- effect: ko
- effect: modifyPower
- effect: sequence
- effect: custom
- card filters: cardIds, names, nameContains, nameNot, categories, colorsAny,
  colorsAll, typesAny, typesAll, attributesAny, attributesAll, cost, power,
  counter, hasKeywords, lacksKeywords, state, owner, controller, excludeSelf,
  custom

Planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage exists:

- condition: donCount
- condition: opponentTurn
- condition: lifeCount
- condition: fieldCount
- condition: handCount
- condition: trashCount
- condition: hasCardInZone
- condition: attackTarget
- condition: cardState
- condition: sourceStillInZone
- condition: eventPayload
- condition: and, or, not, custom
- cost: returnDon
- cost: trashFromHand
- cost: trashSelf
- cost: trashFromField
- cost: discard
- cost: chooseOne
- cost: custom
- duration: untilEndOfTurn
- duration: untilStartOfNextTurn
- duration: whileConditionTrue
- effect: drawUpTo
- effect: search
- effect: lookAtTop
- effect: revealFromZone
- effect: revealTop
- effect: selectFromSet
- effect: selectCards
- effect: moveSelected with position
- effect: putRemaining
- effect: shuffleDeck
- effect: bounce
- effect: trash
- effect: play
- effect: playSelected
- effect: returnUnselectedToDeck
- effect: trashFromHand
- effect: setPowerToZero
- effect: setBasePower
- effect: modifyCost
- effect: setBaseCost
- effect: rest
- effect: activate
- effect: giveKeyword
- effect: removeKeyword
- effect: addDon
- effect: attachDon
- effect: returnDon
- effect: addLife
- effect: damage
- effect: invalidateEffects
- effect: protectFromKO
- effect: cannotAttack
- effect: cannotBlock
- effect: cannotBeAttacked
- effect: cannotBeBlockedBy
- effect: choice
- effect: conditional
- effect: forEachMatch
- effect: repeat
- effect: replacement

new fixture-authorable primitives must add schema coverage and validation fixtures in the same story that makes the primitive authorable.

| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only no-choice K.O. effect resolution for effect primitives already supported by the runtime and only through existing source-presence policy evaluation. Do not add target selection, replacement behavior, custom handlers, optional activation, or new effect primitives.

## Scope

- allow queued onKO no-choice draw effects to resolve through existing queue processing
- support resolveFromDestinationZone when the K.O.'d source is provably in trash at resolution
- support resolveFromLastKnownInformation using sourceSnapshot when the source is no longer resolvable live but snapshot identity/controller matches
- preserve existing lifecycle event behavior for effectResolved and cancellation/fail-closed cases
- run rule processing after K.O. effect resolution using existing queue checkpoint behavior
- fail closed for unsupported onKO effect bodies, missing source proof, optional effects, costs, conditions, target selection, replacement effects, and custom handlers

## Out of Scope

- new effect primitives beyond currently supported no-choice draw
- target selection
- Life Triggers
- replacement effects
- custom handlers
- optional activation
- once-per-turn behavior
- server/client/UI

- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- if resolution requires new primitives, target selection, Life Triggers, replacement effects, custom handlers, optional activation, or schema changes, stop and split or record the blocker
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/source-presence.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-damage-banish.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- queued K.O. no-choice draw effects resolve from trash when using resolveFromDestinationZone
- queued K.O. no-choice draw effects resolve from sourceSnapshot when using resolveFromLastKnownInformation and live source proof is absent
- unsupported source-presence cases fail closed through existing runtime errors or cancellation events without hidden-information leaks
- rule processing still runs after K.O. effect resolution
- repeated equivalent states produce stable event summaries and state hashes

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
