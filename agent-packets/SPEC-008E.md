# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: SPEC-008E
Epic ID: SPEC-008
Title: Generated support policy alignment
Type: specification
Area: docs
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Align generated card support policy with layered composed-effect delivery so CARD stories consume completed contract/schema and runtime capability evidence without weakening fail-closed normal play.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s022 (Poneglyph text-to-DSL pipeline)

The effect-system plan supports three authoring paths:

1. Manual DSL definitions written by developers.
2. Custom TypeScript handlers for cards that cannot be expressed in DSL.
3. Generated DSL from Poneglyph printed card text when certified parser rules produce a complete parse and runtime capability checks pass.

Support ladder:

1. `contract-defined`: a primitive or behavior is described by the Markdown spec or canonical TypeScript contract.
2. `schema-authorable`: `contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` can validate JSON fixtures for that primitive.
3. `runtime-executable`: the current runtime capability matrix proves the engine can execute the primitive, including decisions, visibility, replay, failure policy, and pause/resume behavior.
4. `parser-certified`: reviewed parser rules produce a complete parse for the relevant printed text shape.
5. `generated-support playable`: a generated support record may enable normal play only when the parse is complete and every parsed component has current runtime capability evidence.

Schema authorability alone is insufficient for generated-support playable status. Generated support requires runtime capability evidence and complete parser support; schema validation only proves a JSON shape can be authored.

Generated definitions must never be deployed blindly. A new parser rule, ambiguous parse class, custom handler binding, or wording/ruling ambiguity requires review before it can certify support. Once a parser rule is certified, matching complete-parse cards may be generated without a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map for that common template.

A complete parse covers all gameplay-relevant printed text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement or optionality semantics, and ruling/errata inputs that affect behavior. Multiple parsed effects compose into one generated `EffectDefinition`. Partial parse output may be reported for coverage progress, but it must not make the card playable in normal modes.

Bandai or Poneglyph wording drift must invalidate the affected parse/hash evidence or downgrade support until parser and support evidence are updated. If any parsed component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing runtime capability evidence, the generated definition fails closed instead of partially enabling the card.

```ts
interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  source: "poneglyph";
  sourceTextHash: string;
  generatedBy?: "manual" | "rule-parser" | "llm-assisted";
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewedAt?: string;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  generatedSupportId?: string;
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted. For common templates, implementation may come from a generated support index entry instead of a manual per-card overlay when the complete parse, parser certification, and runtime capability checks all pass.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s012 (Deck validation)

Deck validation resolves and validates against Poneglyph IDs, Poneglyph legality records, and simulator support metadata. Poneglyph is the canonical external source for format/card legality inputs such as legal status, bans, and copy limits; the simulator may only layer unsupported-card policy or platform-specific constraints on top.

Generated support index output is simulator support metadata. Deck validation may treat a generated record as `implemented-dsl` or `implemented-custom` only when the record has complete parse evidence, current source/behavior hashes, certified parser-rule evidence, and a runtime capability matrix result proving every component is supported.

```ts
interface DeckValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: DeckValidationError[];
  warnings: DeckValidationWarning[];
  resolvedCards: ResolvedDeckCard[];
  versions: {
    cardDataVersion: string;
    effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
    overlayVersion: string;
    banlistVersion: string;
  };
}
```

Validation checks:

- Leader count and leader identity.
- Main deck size.
- DON!! deck size.
- Leader/color restrictions.
- Per-card copy limits by Poneglyph base `cardId`.
- Official format restrictions.
- Simulator-specific bans.
- Unsupported-card status.
- Variant IDs resolve to valid Poneglyph variants for the base card.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s014 (Canonical Poneglyph normalization)

The Poneglyph adapter emits `ResolvedCard` from `contracts/canonical-types.ts`. Important normalization rules:

- `attribute` values become `attributes: Attribute[]`; never collapse to a singular attribute.
- `color` values become `colors: CardColor[]`; multi-color cards preserve all colors.
- `variants[].index` becomes `variantIndex`.
- `variantKey = `${cardId}:v${variantIndex}``.
- Missing market prices, product set codes, or image URLs are allowed display gaps and must not fail gameplay resolution.
- Search endpoint DTOs are never accepted as manifest card details. Only detail/batch card payloads can become `ResolvedCard`.
- `sourceTextHash` covers printed effect/trigger text used for implementation drift.
- `behaviorHash` covers stats, type line, effect, trigger, official FAQ, errata, and any source field that can alter behavior.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s015 (Poneglyph text hash and stale-card review)

Every supported card stores a hash of its Poneglyph printed text and, when generated support is used, a behavior hash or parser-evidence hash for the complete parsed behavior.

When the Poneglyph text changes:

1. Mark the card implementation as stale.
2. Fail CI if a stale card remains marked `tested` without review.
3. Prevent ranked use if the changed text affects card behavior.
4. Require parser/support evidence to be updated before generated support may remain playable.
5. Require a reviewer to update the source hash after verifying any DSL/custom handler or certified parser-rule evidence that remains authoritative.

This catches errata, typo fixes that affect parsing, and Poneglyph schema/text changes.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s018 (Effect coverage report)

Generate this in CI from Poneglyph total cards plus simulator overlay status.

```text
Total cards in Poneglyph:      2347
Vanilla confirmed:              420
DSL implemented:               1530
Custom implemented:              73
Unsupported:                    324
Banned in simulator:              0
Implemented cards tested:      1603 / 1603
Cards with stale text hash:       12
```

Primitive usage report:

```text
draw:              321
ko:                118
search:             94
modifyPower:       402
replacement:        27
custom handler:     73
```

High repeated custom-handler usage suggests the DSL is missing primitives.

Effect coverage and primitive usage reports are progress evidence only. They must not promote partial, stale, ambiguous, unparsed, unsupported, or capability-missing generated support into playable normal-mode support.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s022 (Security checklist)

- Server never trusts card metadata from client.
- Poneglyph response is schema-validated before cache write.
- Overlay merge is versioned.
- Match snapshots resolved cards before play starts.
- Unsupported cards are rejected in public modes.
- Variant IDs are cosmetic and never affect rules.
- Poneglyph text hash changes trigger implementation review.
- Replays store versions and manifest hashes.

### 11-testing-quality.s020 (Poneglyph/card-data tests)

Add card-data tests once `@optcg/cards` exists:

```text
CD-001 Poneglyph response validates against Zod schema
CD-002 invalid Poneglyph shape fails before Redis cache write
CD-003 Redis cache key includes cardDataVersion and overlay/effect version
CD-004 overlay merge adds support status and effect definition IDs
CD-005 Poneglyph source text hash drift marks implementation stale
CD-006 unsupported non-vanilla Poneglyph card cannot enter ranked deck
CD-007 variant indexes/generated variant keys are accepted only when valid for the base card
CD-008 client display data cannot alter server-resolved match manifest
CD-009 generated support index accepts only complete-parse cards whose every parsed component is covered by the runtime capability matrix
CD-010 partial, ambiguous, stale, unparsed, unsupported, or capability-missing generated support reports do not make cards playable in normal modes
CD-011 certified parser-rule fixtures auto-support matching complete-parse common-template cards without a manual per-card allowlist
```

These tests prevent the card-data layer from becoming an implicit rules authority.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only minimal specification clarification, generated spec metadata, and narrow authority tests for generated-support policy alignment. Do not change parser code, card fixtures, generated-support metadata, runtime behavior, or support-report tooling.

## Scope

- confirm existing generated-support fail-closed policy
- add minimal clarification that CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema and runtime capability evidence
- clarify that partial support and effect coverage reporting may show progress but never enables normal play
- preserve source integrity, parser certification, runtime capability, review metadata, stale-hash, and support metadata requirements
- add or update authority tests only if needed to pin the layered generated-support policy
- update generated spec metadata

## Out of Scope

- weakening fail-closed generated-support rules
- parser implementation, runtime implementation, contract/schema implementation, real-card fixture changes, generated-support metadata changes, support-report tooling changes
- server, client, API, UI, replay, database, or gameplay implementation

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- specs/09-card-data-and-support-policy.md
- specs/source-coverage-matrix.md
- specs/section-index.json
- specs/spec-manifest.json
- specs/SPEC_VERSION.md
- tests/contracts/spec-authority-gates.test.mjs
- stories/generated/SPEC-008*.yaml
- stories/approved/SPEC-008*.yaml
- agent-packets/SPEC-008E.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- keep this story to minimal policy alignment
- do not implement parser, runtime, schema, support metadata, or fixture behavior
- preserve fail-closed generated-support policy
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- update `tests/contracts/spec-authority-gates.test.mjs` to pin that generated support requires completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence, progress-only reporting remains non-playable, and fail-closed generated-support policy is preserved
- run `corepack pnpm run specs:generate-metadata`
- run `corepack pnpm run specs:verify-metadata`
- run `corepack pnpm run test:contracts`
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- run `corepack pnpm run verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- generated-support policy explicitly says CARD stories consume completed contract/schema and runtime capability evidence
- partial support and effect coverage reporting remain non-playable progress evidence only
- fail-closed generated-support policy is not weakened
- source integrity, parser certification, capability evidence, review metadata, stale hash, and support metadata requirements remain intact
