## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s004 (Engine result)

Every engine call returns a result object rather than only the new state.

```ts
interface EngineResult {
  state: GameState;
  events: EngineEvent[];
  decisions?: PendingDecision[];
  errors?: EngineError[];
  stateHash: string;
}
```

For normal play there should be at most one active `pendingDecision` at a time. Tests may use arrays to inspect internal generated decisions.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s009 (Pending decisions)

Effects, costs, target selection, optional activation, simultaneous trigger ordering, and life triggers all pause through the same model.

```ts
type PendingDecision =
  | ChooseTriggerOrderDecision
  | ChooseOptionalActivationDecision
  | PayCostDecision
  | SelectTargetsDecision
  | SelectCardsDecision
  | ChooseEffectOptionDecision
  | ConfirmLifeTriggerDecision
  | OrderCardsDecision
  | MulliganDecision
  | DeclareLoopCountDecision
  | RollbackConsentDecision;

interface BaseDecision {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  defaultResponse?: DecisionResponse;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s010 (Trigger order)

```ts
interface ChooseTriggerOrderDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "chooseTriggerOrder";
  triggerIds: string[];
  constraints: {
    mustUseAll: true;
  };
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s006 (Effect queue entry)

```ts
interface EffectQueueEntry {
  id: QueueEntryId;
  state: "pending" | "resolving" | "resolved" | "cancelled";
  timingWindowId: TimingWindowId;
  generation: number;
  controllerId: PlayerId;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  triggerEventId?: EngineEventId;
  effectBlockId: EffectId;
  orderingGroup: "turnPlayer" | "nonTurnPlayer";
  createdAtEventSeq: number;
  queuedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  sourcePresencePolicy: SourcePresencePolicy;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s009 (Queue ordering)

Every trigger collection creates or joins a timing window. Queue order is deterministic and must not depend on JavaScript array discovery order except where the spec explicitly says discovery order is the canonical tie-breaker.

Normative ordering algorithm:

```text
1. Assign every collected trigger a timingWindowId.
2. Assign generation = 0 for effects triggered by the original timing event.
3. When resolving an effect produces new triggers, enqueue them with generation = currentGeneration + 1 in the same timing window unless a new official timing window has opened.
4. Resolve older timing windows before newer timing windows.
5. Within a timing window, resolve lower generation before higher generation.
6. Within a generation, resolve turn-player bucket before non-turn-player bucket.
7. Within a player's bucket, if more than one effect is pending, create chooseTriggerOrder for that player.
8. If no choice is required, use stable tie-breakers: createdAtEventSeq, then source instance id, then effect id.
```

Consequences:

- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are pending, and A creates turn player effect C while resolving, B resolves before C.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage points are complete, except `[Trigger]` resolution itself.
- Effects triggered during an effect or card activation wait until the triggering process completes.
- Optional triggered effects create `chooseOptionalActivation` decisions at the point they would enter or begin resolution, according to the card's timing rule.

### 04-effect-runtime.s012 (Player choices during effect resolution)

Effects pause through `PendingDecision`.

Example target selection flow:

```ts
function executeKoEffect(
  state: GameState,
  effect: KoEffect,
  context: EffectContext,
): EngineResult {
  const candidates = resolveTargetCandidates(state, effect.target, context);

  if (requiresChoice(effect.target)) {
    return pauseForDecision(state, {
      type: "selectTargets",
      playerId: resolveChooser(effect.target, context),
      request: effect.target,
      candidates,
      causedBy: context.causedBy,
    });
  }

  return koTargets(state, candidates.selected, context);
}
```

Decision responses are validated by the engine, not the client.

```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

A pull request must not merge unless the main CI pipeline passes.

Minimum required merge gates:

1. install dependencies with locked versions,
2. build/typecheck workspace,
3. lint workspace,
4. run tests,
5. validate contracts and schemas,
6. validate formatting,
7. publish coverage artifact,
8. fail if generated artifacts or snapshots are stale when the repo defines them.

Recommended CI jobs:

- `quality` -> lint, typecheck, format check
- `engine` -> engine unit, interaction, invariant, replay tests
- `contracts` -> canonical types, DSL schema, fixture normalization, SQL/schema validation
- `client-server-smoke` -> protocol smoke tests and filtered-view checks

For protected branches, require at least one human review plus passing CI.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only decision creation at the effect queue processor boundary. This story does not implement response validation or queue resume after the choice.

## Scope

- when processing reaches a choice-required same-player queue group, create a PendingDecision with type chooseTriggerOrder
- include exactly the pending queue entry ids from that group in decision.triggerIds
- set decision.playerId to the group controller and constraints.mustUseAll to true
- emit deterministic decisionCreated event and preserve state hash stability for identical input
- preserve fail-closed behavior for invalid queue ordering input
- leave queue entries pending until a later story implements response handling

## Out of Scope

- response validation
- queue reordering from a response
- automatic queue resume after the choice
- legal-action projection for chooseTriggerOrder
- hidden-info PlayerView projection
- new trigger categories
- Life Trigger reveal path
- optional activation
- target selection
- replacement effects
- server/client/UI

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-025B packet while implementing this story
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify before implementation and review handoff
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-025 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- if decision creation requires canonical type changes, stop and split or record the blocker
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/effect-queue-ordering.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- processEffectRuntime creates chooseTriggerOrder for a multiple-entry same-player group
- decision ids and trigger id order are deterministic for identical input
- decisionCreated event is appended with public visibility and causedBy pointing to rule processing or equivalent current runtime policy
- state.effectQueue remains pending and unchanged except for pendingDecision/eventJournal/sequence changes needed for the decision
- no decision is created when every group has a single entry

## Ambiguity Rule
