# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: SUP-003J
Epic ID: SUP-003
Title: Start-of-game Stage search schema authorability
Type: implementation
Area: contracts
Primary Concern: contract

## Why

Authorize the narrow Effect DSL schema shape used by setup-time start-of-game Stage play support: chooser-only self-deck Stage search to Stage Area followed by same-sequence playSelected.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s008 (Setup sequence)

Use a deterministic setup flow:

```text
1. Validate decks, card support, format, banlist.
2. Determine first/second player.
3. Build initial full GameState.
4. Resolve start-of-game effects that modify setup.
5. Shuffle decks using recorded RNG.
6. Draw opening hands.
7. Handle official mulligan decisions: each player may once either keep or return all 5 to deck, reshuffle, and redraw 5, in first-player-then-second-player order.
8. Place Life from the top of deck equal to Leader life using the canonical orientation algorithm below.
9. Start first player's Refresh Phase.
```

Start-of-game effects that alter decks must happen before final shuffle and opening draw.

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

### 04-effect-runtime.s007 (Source presence policy)

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s010 (Deprecated filter aliases)

The following earlier aliases are not canonical and should not appear in committed DSL fixtures:

A migration adapter may accept these aliases while importing old examples, but CI should reject them in canonical effect-definition fixtures.

Cardinality fields such as `min` and `max` use the exact-N and up-to-N semantics from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`. `drawUpTo` is a planned `chooseQuantity`-backed primitive: it must pause through a `chooseQuantity` pending decision, validate the selected whole integer against public min/max bounds, and draw only the chosen amount when a future runtime story makes it executable.

`drawUpTo` short-deck resolution is do-as-much-as-possible. If the chosen quantity is greater than the number of cards remaining in that player's deck, the runtime must draw every remaining card and emit draw and card-movement events only for cards actually drawn. The next rule-processing checkpoint detects deck-out under `02-engine-mechanics.s035`; the effect does not fail closed before drawing the remaining cards solely because the chosen quantity exceeded the remaining deck size.

Event `seq` values for partial-deck drawUpTo resolution must remain strictly increasing by append order, as required by `03-game-state-events-decisions.s005`. The resolved decision increments `state.seq` once under `03-game-state-events-decisions.s022`; individual draw events do not each advance `state.seq`. State hashes at the replay checkpoints include the post-draw empty deck. Golden replay coverage for drawUpTo short-deck cases must pin the final state hash.

Duration and restriction effects such as `cannotAttack`, `cannotBlock`, `cannotBeAttacked`, `cannotBeBlockedBy`, `invalidateEffects`, and `protectFromKO` remain planned unless the schema coverage policy lists them as schema-supported and the runtime capability matrix proves the active engine can enforce the restriction for the full duration.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s014 (Search request)

```ts
interface SearchRequest {
  zone: "deck" | "trash" | "life";
  player: PlayerRef;

```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s026 (Transient reveal and selection primitives)

```ts
type SelectionSetId = string;
type SelectionId = string;

type Effect =
  | {
      type: "revealTop";
      player: PlayerRef;
      count: number;
      saveAs: SelectionSetId;
      visibility: Visibility;
    }

        chooser: PlayerRef;
        zone: "leaderArea" | "characterArea" | "stageArea" | "costArea";
        player: PlayerRef;
        min: number;
        max: number;
        allowFewerIfUnavailable: boolean;
        filter?: CardFilter;
        visibility: "public";
      };
    }
  | {
      type: "playSelected";
      selection: SelectionId;
      enterRested?: boolean;
      ignoreCost?: boolean;
    }
  | {
      type: "returnUnselectedToDeck";
      set: SelectionSetId;
      player: PlayerRef;
      position: "top" | "bottom";
      order: "original" | "ownerChoice" | "random";
      faceDown: boolean;
    }
  | {
      type: "moveSelected";
      selection: SelectionId;
      from: Zone | SelectionSetId;
      to: Zone;
    };
```

These are not UI concepts. They are deterministic effect-runtime concepts. They let the runtime represent "reveal top card, maybe play it, otherwise return it face-down" without losing hidden-information boundaries.

`selectTargets` is the non-mutating selectedTargets producer contract for same-frame saved field-object references. When a later segment consumes `{ family: "selectedTargets", saveResultAs, ... }`, the producer segment must be `selectTargets` with segment `saveResultAs`; mutating target effects do not act as standalone selectedTargets producer authority.

`playSelected` is planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage and runtime capability evidence exist.

Current schema exception: fixture authorability is scoped to saved hand selections plus one non-hand exception in `trigger: { type: "startOfGame" }` effect blocks only: `selection: "selected:start-of-game"` produced by the same sequence's scoped start-of-game Stage search request (`zone: "deck"`, `player: "self"`, no `lookCount`, `filter.categories: ["stage"]` with nonempty `typesAny`, `min: 0`, `max: 1`, `destination: "stageArea"`, `revealTo: "chooserOnly"`, `shuffleAfter: false`). Generated support may not treat a parsed play-from-selection instruction as playable unless the parser covers the complete selection/play/return flow and the runtime capability matrix covers the resulting decision, hidden-information, forced-trash, and zone-movement behavior.

`playSelected` may consume only an authorized saved hand selection produced by the same supported effect execution frame. At playSelected resolution time, the selected card must still be in that player's hand and must still be legal to play under the current rules and the playSelected options. A stale, non-hand, no-longer-legal, or unsupported saved-reference family fails closed.

A fail-closed stale playSelected segment does not emit `cardPlayed` or hand-to-field `cardMoved` events, records the failed segment as attempted, not succeeded, and not changedState, and then follows the active connector and failure policy. Public events, public legal actions, PlayerView, and SpectatorView must not reveal hidden hand card IDs, private candidates, or unsupported saved-reference details. Replay and private effect logs may retain the internal saved-reference failure reason for audit and deterministic replay.

Event `seq` values and `state.seq` advancement remain deterministic for stale playSelected failures under `03-game-state-events-decisions.s005` and `03-game-state-events-decisions.s022`. State hashes must include the unchanged hand and board state after the failed segment. Golden replay coverage for stale playSelected failures must pin the final state hash.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s027 (Effect-play options)

Effects that say "play" without requiring cost payment should use:

```ts
{ type: 'playSelected', selection: '...', enterRested: true, ignoreCost: true }
```

For the scoped start-of-game Stage exception, the only authorized consumer shape is `{ type: "playSelected", selection: "selected:start-of-game", ignoreCost: true }` (no `enterRested`) in the same sequence as the scoped producer search request in `05-effect-dsl-reference.s026`, and only in `trigger: { type: "startOfGame" }` effect blocks.

The play still obeys rule-processing constraints such as character-area capacity and stage replacement. If the character area is full, the engine must create the forced-trash decision before completing the play.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s029 (Schema coverage policy)

`contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` is the executable JSON fixture contract.
TypeScript/spec primitives outside that JSON schema are planned/not
fixture-authorable until schema validation and fixtures exist.
This list is the fixture-authorability boundary, not generated playable support.
Schema authorability alone does not imply runtime-executable,
parser-certified, or generated-support playable status. New TYP schema stories
may move primitives into the schema-supported fixture subset only when they also
add schema coverage and validation fixtures; generated playable support still
requires complete parser support and runtime capability evidence.

Schema-supported fixture subset:

- trigger: onPlay
- trigger: whenAttacking
- trigger: onOpponentAttack
- trigger: onBlock
- trigger: onKO
- trigger: endOfYourTurn
- trigger: endOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: trigger
- trigger: activateMain
- trigger: main
- trigger: counter
- trigger: permanent
- trigger: startOfGame
- trigger: startOfYourTurn
- trigger: startOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: startOfMainPhase
- trigger: endOfBattle
- trigger: donAttach
- trigger: custom
- condition: yourTurn
- condition: attachedDonCount
- condition: fieldCount
- condition: fieldCount DON filter authorability uses existing `fieldCount` +
  `CardFilter` (`categories` containing `don`) with `player` limited to `self`
  or `opponent`; this remains schema-authorability-only evidence and is not
  runtime/playability support
- condition: trashCount (public `player` + `op` + non-negative safe-integer `value`; optional public filter)
- cost: restDon
- cost: returnDon
- cost: restSelf
- cost: optional trashFromHand through `{ type: "payCost"; cost: OptionalCost }`
  sequence segments only; this is schema authorability for optional cost
  clauses, not non-optional activation `Cost.trashFromHand` authorability and
  not runtime/playability support
- cost: scoped optional choose-one trash cost through
  `{ type: "payCost"; cost: OptionalCost }` sequence segments only. Options are
  limited to the reusable optional `trashFromHand` alternative and scoped

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Contract/schema story only. Do not implement engine runtime behavior, cards parser/generated-support behavior, runtime capability matrix evidence, support reports, overlays, real-card fixture evidence, source hashes, behavior hashes, or card promotion.

## Scope

- authorize only the setup search request shape with `zone: "deck"`, `player: "self"`, no `lookCount`, Stage filter `categories: ["stage"]` plus nonempty `typesAny`, `min: 0`, `max: 1`, `destination: "stageArea"`, `revealTo: "chooserOnly"`, and `shuffleAfter: false`
- authorize only same-sequence `playSelected` consuming the setup search producer selection `selected:start-of-game` with `ignoreCost: true`
- revise `05-effect-dsl-reference.s026`/`s027` to define this as the only non-hand saved selection exception: a same-sequence setup search may produce only `selected:start-of-game` for setup Stage play, while ordinary `playSelected` remains limited to existing authorized hand-selection producers
- update fixture validation semantic guards so this scoped setup search producer is accepted for `playSelected`, while existing hand-selection producer restrictions remain intact for ordinary `playSelected`
- add valid and invalid schema fixtures proving the scoped shape is authorable and adjacent shapes remain rejected
- document the schema-supported fixture subset entry as contract/schema authorability only, not runtime support, parser certification, generated support, or card playability

## Out of Scope

- engine runtime implementation or setup decision behavior
- cards parser/generated-support implementation, runtime capability matrix evidence, support evaluator behavior, support reports, overlays, or card promotion
- deck validation or leader-scoped construction restrictions
- arbitrary start-of-game searches, adding searched cards to hand, reveal-to-both-player setup searches, non-deck setup searches, non-Stage categories, untyped Stage searches, multi-card Stage search, Characters, Events, or comma-separated filters
- real card IDs, real-card fixture capture, source hash updates, behavior hash updates, cards-produced manifests, or supported-card manifests

## Constraints

- implement only SUP-003J while its packet is active
- do not activate or implement SUP-003G until SUP-003J has landed as reviewed prerequisite evidence on the active parent integration branch
- stop and split if authorizing this schema shape requires engine runtime, cards parser, generated-support, or real-card fixture work
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- schema test proving the scoped start-of-game Stage search request has the exact required fields and constants
- valid effect DSL fixture for start-of-game Stage search to Stage Area followed by matching playSelected
- invalid effect DSL fixtures for non-Stage filter, wrong destination, and mismatched playSelected selection
- fixture validator semantic-guard regression proving setup search can produce only `selected:start-of-game` for matching playSelected
- regression proving existing hand-selection playSelected fixtures and invalid playSelected fixtures keep their current behavior
- `corepack pnpm run contracts:validate-effects`
- `corepack pnpm run test:contracts -- tests/contracts/effect-dsl-schema.test.mjs`
- `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- the Effect DSL schema accepts the exact setup start-of-game Stage search plus playSelected sequence shape required by SUP-003D and SUP-003G
- the schema requires canonical `CardFilter.categories` plus `typesAny` and rejects deprecated aliases or non-Stage categories for this setup shape
- the schema rejects wrong destination zones, missing or nonmatching setup selection references, unsupported visibility, unsupported source zones, unsupported max counts, and non-setup playSelected producers
- fixture validation semantic guards allow only this scoped setup search producer to satisfy `playSelected`; ordinary `playSelected` remains tied to its existing authorized producer families
- the spec text explicitly preserves the existing hand-selection-only restriction for ordinary `playSelected` and documents the setup `selected:start-of-game` search producer as a narrow exception
- valid fixtures remain authorability-only and do not claim generated support, review state, tested state, real-card support, runtime capability evidence, or card playability
