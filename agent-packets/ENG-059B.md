# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-059B
Epic ID: ENG-059
Title: Conditional continuous keyword grants
Type: implementation
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Add a reusable engine path for conditionally granting supported public keywords through continuous runtime modifiers, proving the allowlisted public combat keywords through the same generic computed-view path without mutating canonical card state.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s019 (Block Step)

1. Defender may activate one legal `[Blocker]`, unless blocking is prohibited.
2. Blocker rests and becomes the current target.
3. Emit `blockerActivated`.
4. Queue `[On Block]` effects.
5. Resolve the block timing window.
6. If attacker or current target left its zone or is no longer a legal battle participant, skip to End of Battle.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s025 (Keyword behavior)

| Keyword         | Engine behavior                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rush            | Character may attack the turn it was played.                         |
| Rush: Character | Character may attack Characters, not Leader, the turn it was played. |
| Double Attack   | Leader damage count is 2.                                            |
| Banish          | Damaged life card is trashed; no normal trigger/hand path.           |
| Blocker         | During Block Step, can rest to redirect attack.                      |
| Unblockable     | Skips opponent blocker window.                                       |
| Activate: Main  | Legal only during controller's Main Phase outside battle.            |
| Main            | Event usable during controller's Main Phase.                         |
| Counter         | Event usable during opponent's Counter Step.                         |
| Once Per Turn   | Tracked by stable effect ID and card instance per turn.              |
| DON!! xX        | Condition is attached DON!! count greater than or equal to X.        |

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s023 (Error handling inside the engine)

Engine errors are classified.

```ts
type EngineError =
  | { type: "illegalAction"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invalidDecisionResponse"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invariantViolation"; invariant: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "unsupportedCard"; cardId: CardId; status: CardSupportStatus }
  | { type: "effectRuntimeError"; effectId: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "loopDetected"; signature: LoopSignature };
```

Illegal player actions are rejected and logged. Invariant violations and effect runtime errors freeze or recover the match according to the recovery policy.

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

Optionality has three distinct meanings:

- Optional activation asks whether the player commits to resolving the effect block. Declining optional activation means the effect block is not legally committed and once-per-turn usage is not consumed.
- Optional cost asks whether the player pays a non-mandatory cost inside an otherwise committed effect. Declining or failing an optional cost records `paidCost: false` and only skips later instructions whose connector or text depends on that cost being paid.
- Optional effect clause asks whether the player performs a non-mandatory instruction during resolution. Declining an optional effect clause records `playerDeclined: true` for that segment and does not undo prior legally completed segments.

Optional cost clauses inside composed execution are not effect-block activation
costs. They occur after legal commitment to the effect block, inside a
resumable sequence segment. Optional cost accept, decline, and failure do not
consume once-per-turn usage because usage was consumed at legal commitment
before the optional cost clause executes. Accepted optional costs pay cost
atomically and emit the normal cost-payment events. Declined optional costs do
not emit cost-payment events. Failed optional costs emit no public event that
reveals hidden payment candidates or private payment details.

Accepted optional cost records `attempted: true`, `succeeded: true`,
`paidCost: true`, and `playerDeclined: false`; `changedState` records whether
canonical state actually changed. Declined optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: true`. Failed optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: false`. Optional cost accept, decline,
and failure do not consume once-per-turn usage, and dependent connectors use
`paidCost` rather than optional-activation state.
Event `seq` values and `state.seq` advancement remain deterministic for
optional cost accept, decline, and failure. State hashes include the frame
segment result for each branch.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s006 (Conditions)

```ts
type Condition =
  | { type: "donCount"; target?: Target; min: number }
  | { type: "yourTurn" }
  | { type: "opponentTurn" }
  | { type: "lifeCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "fieldCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "handCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "trashCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "leaderColorCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "hasCardInZone"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter: CardFilter }
  | { type: "attackTarget"; targetType: "leader" | "character" | "any" }
  | { type: "cardState"; target: Target; state: "active" | "rested" }
  | { type: "sourceStillInZone" }
  | { type: "eventPayload"; path: string; op: Comparator; value: unknown }
  | { type: "and"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "or"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "not"; condition: Condition }
  | { type: "custom"; check: string };

type Comparator = "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte";
type PlayerRef =
  | "self"
  | "opponent"
  | "turnPlayer"
  | "nonTurnPlayer"
  | "owner"
  | "controller";
```

`leaderColorCount` is a public Leader metadata condition. It reads only the
player's Leader colors from the match manifest or resolved card snapshot, uses a
canonical `PlayerRef` and `Comparator`, and its `value` is a non-negative safe
integer. Printed "multicolored" Leader conditions map to
`{ type: "leaderColorCount", player: "self", op: "gte", value: 2 }`.

Leader type and Leader attribute conditions do not introduce `leaderType` or
`leaderAttribute` predicates. Represent them through the public Leader Area with
`hasCardInZone` and `CardFilter`, for example
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], typesAny: ["Straw Hat Crew"] } }`
or
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], attributesAny: ["slash"] } }`.
The schema-supported fixture subset admits only this public Leader-zone metadata
form and does not authorize private-zone metadata queries.

Condition, duration, and restriction primitives outside the schema-supported fixture subset remain planned layers. They are contract-defined by this reference, but they are not fixture-authorable until the schema coverage policy lists them as supported.

### 06-visibility-security.s005 (Temporary visibility)

Some events reveal hidden cards temporarily.

| Event                    | Who sees                                        | Duration                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Playing card from hand   | Both players                                    | Reveal through placement/resolution            |
| Counter card from hand   | Both players                                    | Reveal through trash/effect resolution         |
| Activated life trigger   | Both players                                    | Reveal through trigger resolution              |
| Declined life trigger    | Nobody except server                            | Never shown                                    |
| Search/look at deck      | Searching player only unless effect says reveal | During effect resolution                       |
| Effect reveals hand/life | As specified by effect                          | During effect resolution or specified duration |
| Trash from hidden zone   | Public once in trash                            | From arrival in trash onward                   |

```ts
interface RevealRecord {
  id: string;
  card: CardRef;
  sourceZone: Zone;
  reason:
    | "play"
    | "counter"
    | "trigger"
    | "search"
    | "lookAt"
    | "effect"
    | "trash";
  visibleTo: "both" | PlayerId[] | "replayOnly";
  expires: RevealExpiration;
}
```

The engine must remove expired `RevealRecord`s as part of effect cleanup.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only engine-core continuous keyword-grant support, computed-view derivation, and tests for supported public keyword grants. Do not change parser support, generated-support records, real-card fixtures, or field removal protection.

## Scope

- add or extend reusable runtime support for continuous keyword-grant modifiers
- evaluate the modifier condition through the supported condition evaluator, including ENG-059A trash-count predicates
- model primitive grant parts equivalent to target "this Character", grant verb "gains", and keyword "[Blocker]" as generic conditional keyword-grant data
- admit exactly `blocker`, `banish`, `rush`, `rushCharacter`, and `doubleAttack` as the story-owned supported public keyword grant allowlist because their runtime behavior can be consumed through touched computed-view, attack-declaration, Block Step, battle-resolution, and battle-damage paths
- derive granted keywords into computed view without mutating canonical card metadata, card instances, source fixtures, or manifest data
- ensure production keyword-grant logic is generic over the supported keyword allowlist and does not branch only for Blocker
- make granted Blocker participate in existing computed `canBlock` eligibility exactly as printed Blocker does when the condition is true
- make granted Banish participate in existing battle-resolution behavior exactly as printed Banish does when the condition is true
- make granted Rush and Rush: Character participate in existing attack-declaration legality exactly as printed Rush and printed Rush: Character do when the condition is true
- make granted Double Attack participate in existing two-damage battle flow exactly as printed Double Attack does when the condition is true
- make granted Blocker disappear when the condition becomes false or the source no longer applies
- preserve existing printed behavior for all supported keywords touched by this story and preserve unsupported keyword fail-closed gates
- preserve deterministic state hashes, event order, hidden-information projection, and canonical-state nonmutation

## Out of Scope

- production special cases for a real card ID or full-card text matching
- field-removal protection
- parser support, generated-support evidence, support reports, real-card fixtures, source hashes, or behavior hashes
- adding support for unsupported keywords, private/hidden keyword grants, or broad keyword layering outside the explicit supported public keyword allowlist
- claiming full runtime behavior for any keyword outside `blocker`, `banish`, `rush`, `rushCharacter`, and `doubleAttack`
- changing Block Step decision flow except where computed eligibility already consumes Blocker
- mutating canonical card keywords or manifest metadata
- shared TYP/contracts/schema changes unless an approved prerequisite requires them
- server, client, API, UI, database, replay UI, WebSocket, Redis, or live Poneglyph work

## Constraints

- generate and activate the ENG-059B packet before implementation
- do not activate or hand off ENG-059B until ENG-059A has landed as reviewed commit evidence on the parent branch
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- do not import @optcg/cards
- do not add parser/generated-support/card fixture work
- fail closed if keyword grant semantics, condition timing, source liveness, Block Step eligibility, or hidden-information behavior is ambiguous
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- story-review for ENG-059B before approval handoff
- unit test proving a Character with a true trash-count condition gains computed Blocker and can block during defender Block Step
- unit test proving the same Character does not gain Blocker below the trash-count threshold
- unit tests proving Banish, Rush, Rush: Character, and Double Attack are conditionally granted through the same reusable keyword-grant path
- unit test proving battle resolution consumes granted Banish the same way it consumes printed Banish
- unit tests proving attack declaration consumes granted Rush and granted Rush: Character the same way it consumes printed Rush and printed Rush: Character
- unit test proving battle damage consumes granted Double Attack the same way it consumes printed Double Attack
- true, false, stale-source, and unsupported keyword tests cover every allowlisted keyword (`blocker`, `banish`, `rush`, `rushCharacter`, `doubleAttack`) unless a test matrix proves the shared helper path once and behavior-path tests cover each keyword
- unit test proving the granted keyword disappears when the condition flips from true to false
- unit test proving source removal or stale source state removes the granted keyword from computed view
- unit tests proving rested, non-defender, non-Character, stale, and attacker-controlled cards remain ineligible to block
- regression tests proving printed Blocker behavior remains unchanged
- fail-closed tests for unsupported keyword grants and unsupported grant conditions
- canonical-state nonmutation and state-hash tests for true, false, and stale-source paths
- eventJournal and no-event mutation checks for true, false, stale-source, and unsupported keyword-grant paths
- hidden-info tests proving conditional keyword grants do not expose private zone identities
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck`
- run focused engine-core compute-view, battle, continuous-modifier, and hidden-info tests touched by this story
- run `corepack pnpm run test:hidden-info`
- run `corepack pnpm run coverage`
- run `corepack pnpm run verify`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- a supported continuous modifier can grant `blocker`, `banish`, `rush`, `rushCharacter`, or `doubleAttack` while its supported condition is true
- the same modifier grants no keyword while its supported condition is false
- every allowlisted keyword uses the same generic keyword-grant path, with no Blocker-only or keyword-specific production branch beyond routing through existing keyword behavior consumers
- computed view and Block Step eligibility consume the granted keyword through the same public computed path as printed Blocker
- battle resolution consumes granted Banish through the same public computed path as printed Banish
- attack declaration consumes granted Rush and Rush: Character through the same public computed path as printed Rush and printed Rush: Character
- battle damage consumes granted Double Attack through the same public computed path as printed Double Attack
- source removal or stale source state removes the granted keyword from computed view
- canonical card metadata, manifest data, and card instances are not mutated by the grant
- unsupported keyword grants or unsupported conditions fail closed without exposing hidden information
- production engine code does not import @optcg/cards and does not mention real card IDs
