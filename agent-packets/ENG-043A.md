## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s042 (Once-per-turn consumption)

The engine records `[Once Per Turn]` usage in `GameState.oncePerTurn` by `cardInstanceId + effectId + turnNumber`.

Use is consumed only after the activation is legally committed:

1. Conditions required at activation have passed.
2. Required activation targets, if any, have been selected legally.
3. Required costs have been paid successfully.
4. The player has accepted an optional activation, if the effect is optional.

If a player declines an optional effect, cannot pay a cost, or cannot make a required activation-time selection, once-per-turn use is not consumed. If the effect is legally committed and later fizzles, loses its target, or does as much as possible during resolution, the once-per-turn use remains consumed.

For automatic once-per-turn effects, optional decline does not consume use; accepted automatic effects consume use when their queue entry begins resolution.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s001 (Effect DSL Reference)

Effect definitions are keyed by **Poneglyph base card ID**. Poneglyph supplies the printed card text and metadata; the simulator DSL supplies executable rule behavior. The DSL should store a source-text hash so a Poneglyph text change can trigger implementation review.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only reusable once-per-turn state helpers and helper tests. Do not wire helpers into effect runtime, legal action filtering, optional activation, costs, or target resolution in this story.

## Scope

- add a cohesive engine-core helper module for once-per-turn lookup and consumption
- key usage by `cardInstanceId`, `effectId`, and `turnNumber`
- append an immutable `OncePerTurnRecord` with `usedAtStateSeq` when consuming an unused key
- make repeated helper consumption for the same key idempotent or fail-closed without duplicating records
- preserve records from prior turns so historical state hashes remain deterministic
- add invariant coverage for duplicate same-key once-per-turn records if the existing invariant module is the right enforcement point

## Out of Scope

- integrating helpers into effect runtime paths
- legal action filtering
- optional activation behavior
- cost or target decision behavior
- new event types for once-per-turn records
- real-card fixtures or card-data integration
- server, client, API, Redis, live Poneglyph, or UI work

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/once-per-turn.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/once-per-turn.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/invariants.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/invariants.test.ts
- stories/generated/ENG-043A-once-per-turn-state-helpers.yaml
- stories/approved/ENG-043A-once-per-turn-state-helpers.yaml
- agent-packets/ENG-043A.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-043A packet while implementing this story
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify` before implementation and review handoff
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-043 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- run `corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/once-per-turn.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/invariants.test.ts`
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck`
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`
- run `corepack pnpm run verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- helpers identify a used key by exact card instance id, effect id, and turn number
- helpers do not treat a prior-turn record as used for a later turn
- consuming an unused key returns a new state with exactly one matching record and stable `usedAtStateSeq`
- repeated consumption of the same key cannot create duplicate matching records
- helper tests cover same-card different-effect, same-effect different-card, same-key same-turn, and same-key different-turn cases

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
