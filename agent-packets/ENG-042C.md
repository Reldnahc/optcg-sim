# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-042C
Epic ID: KICK-001
Title: Accept optional queued effects through existing runtime resolution
Type: implementation
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Add the accept response path for optional queued no-choice draw effects so an accepted optional effect resolves through the existing queue runtime.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s004 (Authority and official-rules defaults)

- Official card wording overrides the comprehensive rules when they conflict.
- Official FAQ/rulings/errata refine behavior when printed text alone is insufficient.
- The simulator must implement that authority through DSL/custom handlers and card-specific tests.
- Simultaneous player choices are ordered turn player first, then non-turn player.
- When both players have triggered effects at the same timing, turn-player effects resolve first under the official timing rules.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until damage processing is complete, except for `[Trigger]` handling which follows the official interrupt path.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s042 (Once-per-turn consumption)

The engine records `[Once Per Turn]` usage in `GameState.oncePerTurn` by `cardInstanceId + effectId + turnNumber`.

Use is consumed only after the activation is legally committed:

1. Conditions required at activation have passed.
2. Required activation targets, if any, have been selected legally.
3. Required costs have been paid successfully.
4. The player has accepted an optional activation, if the effect is optional.

If a player declines an optional effect, cannot pay a cost, or cannot make a required activation-time selection, once-per-turn use is not consumed. If the effect is legally committed and later fizzles, loses its target, or does as much as possible during resolution, the once-per-turn use remains consumed.

For automatic once-per-turn effects, optional decline does not consume use; accepted automatic effects consume use when their queue entry begins resolution.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s009 (Pending decisions)

Effects, costs, target selection, optional activation, simultaneous trigger ordering, and life triggers all pause through the same model.

```ts
type PendingDecision =
  | ChooseTriggerOrderDecision
  | ChooseOptionalActivationDecision
  | PayCostDecision
  | SelectTargetsDecision
  | SelectCardsDecision
  | ChooseEffectOptionDecision
  | ConfirmLifeTriggerDecision
  | OrderCardsDecision
  | MulliganDecision
  | DeclareLoopCountDecision
  | RollbackConsentDecision;

interface BaseDecision {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  defaultResponse?: DecisionResponse;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s011 (Optional activation)

```ts
interface ChooseOptionalActivationDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "chooseOptionalActivation";
  effectId: string;
  source: CardRef;
  options: ["activate", "decline"];
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s016 (Action envelope inside the engine)

The server-facing protocol envelope is defined separately. The engine action should be pure data.

```ts
type Action =
  | { type: "playCard"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; costPayment?: PaymentSpec }
  | {
      type: "activateEffect";
      source: CardRef;
      effectId: string;
      costPayment?: PaymentSpec;
    }
  | { type: "attachDon"; donInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | {
      type: "respondToDecision";
      decisionId: string;
      response: DecisionResponse;
    };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 04-effect-runtime.s009 (Queue ordering)

Every trigger collection creates or joins a timing window. Queue order is deterministic and must not depend on JavaScript array discovery order except where the spec explicitly says discovery order is the canonical tie-breaker.

Normative ordering algorithm:

```text
1. Assign every collected trigger a timingWindowId.
2. Assign generation = 0 for effects triggered by the original timing event.
3. When resolving an effect produces new triggers, enqueue them with generation = currentGeneration + 1 in the same timing window unless a new official timing window has opened.
4. Resolve older timing windows before newer timing windows.
5. Within a timing window, resolve lower generation before higher generation.
6. Within a generation, resolve turn-player bucket before non-turn-player bucket.
7. Within a player's bucket, if more than one effect is pending, create chooseTriggerOrder for that player.
8. If no choice is required, use stable tie-breakers: createdAtEventSeq, then source instance id, then effect id.
```

Consequences:

- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are pending, and A creates turn player effect C while resolving, B resolves before C.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage points are complete, except `[Trigger]` resolution itself.
- Effects triggered during an effect or card activation wait until the triggering process completes.
- Optional triggered effects create `chooseOptionalActivation` decisions at the point they would enter or begin resolution, according to the card's timing rule.

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s012 (Player choices during effect resolution)

Effects pause through `PendingDecision`.

Example target selection flow:

```ts
function executeKoEffect(
  state: GameState,
  effect: KoEffect,
  context: EffectContext,
): EngineResult {
  const candidates = resolveTargetCandidates(state, effect.target, context);

  if (requiresChoice(effect.target)) {
    return pauseForDecision(state, {
      type: "selectTargets",
      playerId: resolveChooser(effect.target, context),
      request: effect.target,
      candidates,
      causedBy: context.causedBy,
    });
  }

  return koTargets(state, candidates.selected, context);
}
```

Decision responses are validated by the engine, not the client.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only valid accept handling for existing chooseOptionalActivation decisions and the minimal queue-resume marker needed to avoid re-prompting the accepted entry. Stop before costs, targets, once-per-turn, or new primitives.

## Scope

- validate `optionalActivation` activate responses for the current optional activation decision
- clear the pending decision and append deterministic `decisionResolved` evidence
- resume the accepted queued no-choice draw effect through the existing effect resolution path
- continue later runtime queue processing after the accepted effect resolves
- document in code or tests that once-per-turn consumption remains a future integration point outside this story
- prove accept draws through the same primitive path and emits deterministic event order/hash coverage

## Out of Scope

- optional target effects
- optional costs or once-per-turn consumption implementation
- replacement effects
- new primitives
- real-card fixtures or card-data integration
- server, client, API, Redis, live Poneglyph, or UI work
