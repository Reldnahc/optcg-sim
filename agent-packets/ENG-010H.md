## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s016 (Playing a card)

Playing a card from hand is a structured action:

```text
1. Reveal card from hand.
2. Compute total cost from base cost plus continuous cost modifiers.
3. Clamp final negative cost to 0.
4. Select required active DON!! in cost area.
5. Rest selected DON!!.
6. If playing a Character while character area is full, choose and trash one existing Character by rule process; no triggers.
7. If playing a Stage while stage area is full, trash existing Stage.
8. Place card in destination or trash Event before resolving Event effect.
9. Emit cardPlayed/cardMoved events.
10. Detect and queue [On Play] or Event effects as appropriate.
```

Cost payment should be represented as a `PendingDecision` if the player must choose exactly which DON!! or additional cards to pay.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s022 (Internal state sequencing)

```ts
type StateSeq = number & { __brand: "StateSeq" };

interface TurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}
```

Increment `state.seq` after every accepted action or resolved decision, not after every internal event. Internal events have their own sequence inside the event journal.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s023 (Error handling inside the engine)

Engine errors are classified.

```ts
type EngineError =
  | { type: "illegalAction"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invalidDecisionResponse"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invariantViolation"; invariant: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "unsupportedCard"; cardId: CardId; status: CardSupportStatus }
  | { type: "effectRuntimeError"; effectId: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "loopDetected"; signature: LoopSignature };
```

Illegal player actions are rejected and logged. Invariant violations and effect runtime errors freeze or recover the match according to the recovery policy.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 11-testing-quality.s010 (Golden replay tests)

Store known game scripts and final state hashes.

```text
fixtures/replays/
  vanilla-basic-game.json
  blocker-counter-basic.json
  double-attack-life-trigger.json
  simultaneous-ko-triggers.json
  replacement-trigger-trash.json
```

CI replays them and checks:

- Final state hash.
- Checkpoint hashes.
- Event count/type sequence, optionally.
- No hidden-info leak in generated views.

### 11-testing-quality.s012 (Replay drift tests)

Whenever engine or effect definitions change:

1. Replay previous golden logs under the intended version bundle.
2. Compare checkpoint hashes.
3. Fail CI on unexpected drift.
4. Require migration/version-pin note for intentional drift.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code.
- The client must not import `engine-core` once hidden state exists; use `view-engine`.
- The card-data package may call Poneglyph, but effect resolution must consume resolved manifests, not live HTTP calls.
- Unsupported cards must fail closed outside dev sandbox.

### 18-acceptance-tests.s004 (Milestone 2 - first effect runtime)

```text
M2-001 On Play draw queues and resolves
M2-002 When Attacking effect resolves before defender On Opponent Attack window
M2-003 blocker redirects attack and emits blockerActivated
M2-004 counter character grants battle power until end of battle
M2-005 counter event is trashed and effect resolves
M2-006 On K.O. activates on field and resolves from trash or last known info
M2-007 life Trigger resolves from no zone then moves to trash unless replaced
M2-008 simultaneous triggers controlled by same player require order decision
M2-009 turn player effect A, opponent effect B, new turn-player effect C resolves A-B-C
M2-010 damage-processing triggers wait until all damage points complete
M2-011 continuous +1000 modifier does not mutate base state
M2-012 replacement effect applies once per process
M2-013 optional effect creates chooseOptionalActivation decision
M2-014 target selection respects visibility and legal candidates
M2-015 unsupported non-vanilla card is rejected outside dev sandbox
M2-016 once-per-turn failed cost does not consume use
M2-017 once-per-turn committed effect that later fizzles still consumes use
M2-018 defender on-opponent-attack effects resolve before ordinary counter actions
M2-019 post-counter missing attacker or target skips Damage Step
M2-020 replacement choice uses chooseReplacement decision and logs replacementApplied
M2-021 replacement cannot apply twice to same process
M2-022 transient revealed card returned face-down is removed from opponent view
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only test coverage for existing play-card unsupported effect behavior and replay smoke hash stability. Stop before production behavior changes, start-of-main changes, battle changes, trigger detection, queue execution, legal-action gating, or replay schema changes.

## Scope

- add or tighten guard coverage proving supported Event card play remains supported where already supported
- add or tighten guard coverage proving Event effect execution and On Play effect execution remain unsupported and fail-closed where currently unsupported
- preserve replay smoke fixture hashes after ENG-010D and ENG-010G runtime scaffold integrations

## Out of Scope

- changing production code
- changing accepted vanilla play-card behavior
- changing replay fixtures, replay schema, event id format, event seq allocation, event visibility, state sequence increments, state hash behavior, rule-processing timing, or invariant timing
- implementing trigger detection, queue execution, source-presence policy, blocker, counter, life triggers, Event effects, On Play effects, replacement, continuous effects, or once-per-turn tracking
- changing CLI grammar, server protocol, browser UI, database, Redis, WebSocket, React, live HTTP, or Poneglyph behavior

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/play-card.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/replay-smoke.test.ts

## Constraints

- keep the patch test-only; if production behavior must change, stop and split or record the ambiguity
- fail closed on ambiguous gameplay rule, timing-window, source-presence, support-policy, replay, or hidden-information behavior
- keep engine-core deterministic and pure
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- unit or existing test coverage proving supported Event card play remains supported where already supported with unchanged accepted event output and state mutation semantics
- unit or existing test coverage proving Event effect execution remains unsupported and fail-closed with expected rejection type/reason, no state mutation, no emitted events, and legal-action omission where currently omitted
- unit or existing test coverage proving On Play effect execution remains unsupported and fail-closed with expected rejection type/reason, no state mutation, no emitted events, and legal-action omission where currently omitted
- existing `packages/engine-core/src/replay-smoke.test.ts` must pass with unchanged replay smoke fixture hashes
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck` must pass
- `corepack pnpm run verify` must pass

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- supported Event card play remains supported where already supported
- Event effect execution and On Play effect execution remain unsupported and fail-closed where currently unsupported
- replay smoke fixture hashes remain unchanged
- no production files are changed

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
