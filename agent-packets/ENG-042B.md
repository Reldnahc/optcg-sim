# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-042B
Epic ID: KICK-001
Title: Decline optional queued effects without resolving them
Type: implementation
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Add the decline response path for optional queued no-choice draw effects so declined effects are skipped and runtime processing continues deterministically.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s009 (Pending decisions)

Effects, costs, target selection, optional activation, simultaneous trigger ordering, and life triggers all pause through the same model.

```ts
type PendingDecision =
  | ChooseTriggerOrderDecision
  | ChooseOptionalActivationDecision
  | PayCostDecision
  | SelectTargetsDecision
  | SelectCardsDecision
  | ChooseEffectOptionDecision
  | ConfirmLifeTriggerDecision
  | OrderCardsDecision
  | MulliganDecision
  | DeclareLoopCountDecision
  | RollbackConsentDecision;

interface BaseDecision {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  defaultResponse?: DecisionResponse;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s011 (Optional activation)

```ts
interface ChooseOptionalActivationDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "chooseOptionalActivation";
  effectId: string;
  source: CardRef;
  options: ["activate", "decline"];
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s016 (Action envelope inside the engine)

The server-facing protocol envelope is defined separately. The engine action should be pure data.

```ts
type Action =
  | { type: "playCard"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; costPayment?: PaymentSpec }
  | {
      type: "activateEffect";
      source: CardRef;
      effectId: string;
      costPayment?: PaymentSpec;
    }
  | { type: "attachDon"; donInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | {
      type: "respondToDecision";
      decisionId: string;
      response: DecisionResponse;
    };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 04-effect-runtime.s009 (Queue ordering)

Every trigger collection creates or joins a timing window. Queue order is deterministic and must not depend on JavaScript array discovery order except where the spec explicitly says discovery order is the canonical tie-breaker.

Normative ordering algorithm:

```text
1. Assign every collected trigger a timingWindowId.
2. Assign generation = 0 for effects triggered by the original timing event.
3. When resolving an effect produces new triggers, enqueue them with generation = currentGeneration + 1 in the same timing window unless a new official timing window has opened.
4. Resolve older timing windows before newer timing windows.
5. Within a timing window, resolve lower generation before higher generation.
6. Within a generation, resolve turn-player bucket before non-turn-player bucket.
7. Within a player's bucket, if more than one effect is pending, create chooseTriggerOrder for that player.
8. If no choice is required, use stable tie-breakers: createdAtEventSeq, then source instance id, then effect id.
```

Consequences:

- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are pending, and A creates turn player effect C while resolving, B resolves before C.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage points are complete, except `[Trigger]` resolution itself.
- Effects triggered during an effect or card activation wait until the triggering process completes.
- Optional triggered effects create `chooseOptionalActivation` decisions at the point they would enter or begin resolution, according to the card's timing rule.

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s012 (Player choices during effect resolution)

Effects pause through `PendingDecision`.

Example target selection flow:

```ts
function executeKoEffect(
  state: GameState,
  effect: KoEffect,
  context: EffectContext,
): EngineResult {
  const candidates = resolveTargetCandidates(state, effect.target, context);

  if (requiresChoice(effect.target)) {
    return pauseForDecision(state, {
      type: "selectTargets",
      playerId: resolveChooser(effect.target, context),
      request: effect.target,
      candidates,
      causedBy: context.causedBy,
    });
  }

  return koTargets(state, candidates.selected, context);
}
```

Decision responses are validated by the engine, not the client.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only valid decline handling for existing chooseOptionalActivation decisions. Stop before implementing accept behavior or unrelated decision types.

## Scope

- validate `optionalActivation` decline responses for the current optional activation decision
- reject non-decline responses in this story unless already supported by another story
- remove the declined queue entry without resolving its effect
- clear the pending decision and append deterministic `decisionResolved` evidence
- resume existing queue processing after the declined entry is removed
- prove decline leaves deck/hand and effect resolution events unchanged for the declined effect

## Out of Scope

- accept response handling
- PlayerView projection
- unsupported optional target/cost shapes beyond preserving existing fail-closed behavior
- once-per-turn consumption
- real-card fixtures or card-data integration
- server, client, API, Redis, live Poneglyph, or UI work

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-042B packet while implementing this story
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify before implementation and review handoff
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-042 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime-optional-activation.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- a valid decline response clears the optional decision and removes the selected optional queue entry
- the declined optional effect does not draw cards and does not emit `effectResolved`
- later queued runtime work continues through existing processing
- decline produces deterministic event order and state hash coverage

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text

Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
