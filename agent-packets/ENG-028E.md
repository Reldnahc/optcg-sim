## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s023 (Damage processing)

For each point of damage:

1. If player has 0 life, mark defeat condition and run rule processing.
2. Otherwise, take the top life card.
3. If the card has `[Trigger]`, ask whether to reveal and activate it instead of adding it to hand.
4. If trigger is activated, the card is temporarily in no zone while the trigger resolves.
5. After trigger resolution, trash the card unless the trigger or a replacement says otherwise.
6. If trigger is declined or unavailable, add the card to hand hidden.

When damage is greater than 1, repeat this process one point at a time in official order.

`[Banish]` replaces the normal life-to-hand/trigger path by trashing the life card instead.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s040 (Trigger card zone)

When a Life card with `[Trigger]` is activated:

1. The card is revealed.
2. It is in no zone while the trigger resolves.
3. After resolution, it is trashed unless the trigger or a replacement says otherwise.

The `[Trigger]` trash is replaceable if a replacement effect specifically applies.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s014 (Life trigger)

```ts
interface ConfirmLifeTriggerDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "confirmLifeTrigger";
  card: CardRef;
  options: ["activateTrigger", "addToHand"];
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s015 (Legal actions)

`getLegalActions()` should return actions valid for the current game state and current pending decision.

```ts
function getLegalActions(state: GameState, playerId: PlayerId): LegalAction[] {
  if (state.pendingDecision) {
    return legalResponsesForDecision(state.pendingDecision, playerId, state);
  }

  return legalPhaseActions(state, playerId);
}
```

Legal actions sent to a client must not leak hidden information. For example, the opponent should not receive an action list that implies exactly which hidden counter cards exist.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s018 (Canonical event visibility)

Each `EngineEvent` has one visibility policy:

```text
public          safe for both players immediately
private         visible only to listed player IDs
replayOnly      hidden during live play but available in completed full replay
serverOnly      never leaves trusted server/runtime logs
```

Visibility is independent of replay determinism. Replay artifacts may store information that was never sent to either player during the live match.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 06-visibility-security.s004 (PlayerView shape)

```ts
interface PlayerView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  self: VisiblePlayerState;
  opponent: OpponentVisibleState;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PublicDecision;
  legalActions: PublicLegalAction[];
  revealedCards: PublicRevealRecord[];
  events: EngineEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Do not include:

- Deck order.
- Opponent hand card IDs.
- Face-down life card IDs.
- RNG seed/internal state.
- Effect queue internals.
- Private decision candidates not visible to recipient.
- Internal crash/recovery metadata.

Canonical public support DTOs for the initial live view contract:

```ts
type SpectatorPolicy = {
  mode: "disabled" | "live-filtered";
  allowHandRevealAfterGame: boolean;
};

interface PublicTurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}

interface PublicBattleState {
  attacker: CardRef;
  originalTarget: CardRef;
  currentTarget: CardRef;
  blocker?: CardRef;
  step: BattleStep;
  damageCount: number;
}

interface PublicCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  attachedDonCount: number;
  turnPlayed?: number;
}

interface PublicLifeView {
  count: number;
  faceUpCards: PublicCardView[];
}

interface VisiblePlayerState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  hand: PublicCardView[];
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

interface OpponentVisibleState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  handCount: number;
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

type SpectatorVisiblePlayerState = OpponentVisibleState;

interface PublicDecision {
  id: DecisionId;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

type PublicLegalAction =
  | { type: "playCard"; card: CardRef; costPaymentRequired?: boolean }
  | { type: "activateEffect"; source: CardRef; effectId: EffectId }
  | { type: "attachDon"; don: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; card: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "respondToDecision"; decisionId: DecisionId };

interface PublicRevealRecord {
  id: string;
  cards: CardRef[];
  visibility: "public" | "privateToRecipient";
  origin: ZoneRef | "topOfDeck" | "lifeDamage" | "custom";
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  cleanupPolicy: "returnToOrigin" | "trashAfterResolution" | "none";
}

type SpectatorRevealRecord = Omit<PublicRevealRecord, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: "public";
};

type SpectatorEvent = Omit<EngineEvent, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: { type: "public" };
};
```

Initial live-filtered spectator view is distinct from `PlayerView`:

```ts
interface SpectatorView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  spectatorPolicy: SpectatorPolicy;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, SpectatorVisiblePlayerState>;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  revealedCards: SpectatorRevealRecord[];
  events: SpectatorEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Initial `SpectatorView` has no `pendingDecision` or `legalActions` field.
It does not include either player's hand card IDs, deck order, face-down life
card IDs, private reveal records, non-public events, RNG state, effect queue
internals, or audit entries. Full-information live spectating is deferred to a
future explicit policy story.

### 06-visibility-security.s005 (Temporary visibility)

Some events reveal hidden cards temporarily.

| Event                    | Who sees                                        | Duration                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Playing card from hand   | Both players                                    | Reveal through placement/resolution            |
| Counter card from hand   | Both players                                    | Reveal through trash/effect resolution         |
| Activated life trigger   | Both players                                    | Reveal through trigger resolution              |
| Declined life trigger    | Nobody except server                            | Never shown                                    |
| Search/look at deck      | Searching player only unless effect says reveal | During effect resolution                       |
| Effect reveals hand/life | As specified by effect                          | During effect resolution or specified duration |
| Trash from hidden zone   | Public once in trash                            | From arrival in trash onward                   |

```ts
interface RevealRecord {
  id: string;
  card: CardRef;
  sourceZone: Zone;
  reason:
    | "play"
    | "counter"
    | "trigger"
    | "search"
    | "lookAt"
    | "effect"
    | "trash";
  visibleTo: "both" | PlayerId[] | "replayOnly";
  expires: RevealExpiration;
}
```

The engine must remove expired `RevealRecord`s as part of effect cleanup.

### 06-visibility-security.s006 (Effect event visibility)

The game log can leak information if not filtered.

```ts
interface EffectEvent {
  id: string;
  sourceCardId: CardId;
  sourceInstanceId?: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  description: string;
  choices?: PublicChoiceSummary;
  visibleTo: "both" | PlayerId[] | "replayOnly";
}
```

Examples:

- Public target selection: visible to both.
- Searching deck: opponent sees "Opponent is searching deck" and maybe count, not card IDs.
- Choosing a card from hand to trash: opponent sees the resulting public trash card, not pre-choice hand options.

### 06-visibility-security.s007 (Legal-action visibility)

Legal actions can leak hidden information. The view should expose only what that recipient is entitled to know.

Examples:

- The defender should not see exactly why the server auto-passed the counter window.
- A player may see their own legal counter cards.
- The opponent sees only that the game progressed, not whether no counters existed or auto-pass was enabled.

### 11-testing-quality.s011 (Hidden-information tests)

For every view-filtering change:

- Assert opponent hand card IDs absent.
- Assert deck order absent.
- Assert face-down life absent.
- Assert RNG state absent.
- Assert effect queue internals absent.
- Assert temporary reveals are recipient-filtered.
- Assert declined triggers never reveal card IDs.
- Assert spectator policy applied.

Create fixtures for each reveal scenario.

### 18-acceptance-tests.s004 (Milestone 2 - first effect runtime)

```text
M2-001 On Play draw queues and resolves
M2-002 When Attacking effect resolves before defender On Opponent Attack window
M2-003 blocker redirects attack and emits blockerActivated
M2-004 counter character grants battle power until end of battle
M2-005 counter event is trashed and effect resolves
M2-006 On K.O. activates on field and resolves from trash or last known info
M2-007 life Trigger resolves from no zone then moves to trash unless replaced
M2-008 simultaneous triggers controlled by same player require order decision
M2-009 turn player effect A, opponent effect B, new turn-player effect C resolves A-B-C
M2-010 damage-processing triggers wait until all damage points complete
M2-011 continuous +1000 modifier does not mutate base state
M2-012 replacement effect applies once per process
M2-013 optional effect creates chooseOptionalActivation decision
M2-014 target selection respects visibility and legal candidates
M2-015 unsupported non-vanilla card is rejected outside dev sandbox
M2-016 once-per-turn failed cost does not consume use
M2-017 once-per-turn committed effect that later fizzles still consumes use
M2-018 defender on-opponent-attack effects resolve before ordinary counter actions
M2-019 post-counter missing attacker or target skips Damage Step
M2-020 replacement choice uses chooseReplacement decision and logs replacementApplied
M2-021 replacement cannot apply twice to same process
M2-022 transient revealed card returned face-down is removed from opponent view
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only integration/regression coverage and the smallest necessary repair if the regression exposes a landed bug in ENG-028A through ENG-028D. Do not add new life-trigger behavior beyond the landed child stories.

## Scope

- verify declined Trigger cards never reveal card identity or Trigger metadata to the opponent
- verify activated Trigger cards reveal publicly only after activateTrigger response
- verify no-zone activated Trigger state does not leak server-only runtime internals or hidden adjacent Life/deck/hand identities
- verify legal actions expose the confirmLifeTrigger response only to the damaged player
- verify event filtering hides private decline details and keeps public activation audit data deterministic
- verify Banish still bypasses the normal trigger/hand path
- verify event sequencing and state hashes remain stable across decline and activation paths

## Out of Scope

- new life-trigger behavior beyond ENG-028A through ENG-028D
- Banish changes
- Double Attack or multiple damage handling
- replacement effects
- complex Trigger effects
- search, look, or reveal primitives
- target selection
- server/client/UI

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-028E packet while implementing this story
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify before implementation and review handoff
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-028 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- if verification requires new gameplay behavior rather than a narrow repair to landed ENG-028 behavior, stop and split or record the blocker
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/life-trigger-actions.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/filter-state-for-player.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/filter-state-for-player.real-states.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/actions.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/event-sequencing-regression.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-damage-banish.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- real-state PlayerView tests cover pre-decision, declined, activated/no-zone, and resolved Trigger states
- opponent views never include declined Trigger card identity, adjacent Life identities, deck order, hidden hand contents, effectQueue internals, or transient no-zone internals
- both players see activated Trigger identity only during the public reveal/no-zone window and public trash state after supported resolution
- legal actions for the non-recipient do not reveal that a hidden Trigger decision exists beyond allowed public battle pause state
- event sequencing and state hash regression coverage includes both decline and activation paths
- Banish regression confirms no life-trigger decision or reveal is created
