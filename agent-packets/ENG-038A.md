## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s014 (Main Phase)

Before the turn player receives action priority, emit `phaseStarted(main)`, collect `[Start of Main Phase]` triggers, and resolve required automatic effects. If any pending decision is created, Main Phase action priority does not begin until that decision and the resulting queue are complete.

Turn player may repeatedly:

- Play a Character, Stage, or `[Main]` Event from hand.
- Activate `[Activate: Main]` effects.
- Give active DON!! to Leader or Characters.
- Declare an attack, if legal.
- End the phase.

Neither player can attack on their first turn.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s016 (Playing a card)

Playing a card from hand is a structured action:

```text
1. Reveal card from hand.
2. Compute total cost from base cost plus continuous cost modifiers.
3. Clamp final negative cost to 0.
4. Select required active DON!! in cost area.
5. Rest selected DON!!.
6. If playing a Character while character area is full, choose and trash one existing Character by rule process; no triggers.
7. If playing a Stage while stage area is full, trash existing Stage.
8. Place card in destination or trash Event before resolving Event effect.
9. Emit cardPlayed/cardMoved events.
10. Detect and queue [On Play] or Event effects as appropriate.
```

Cost payment should be represented as a `PendingDecision` if the player must choose exactly which DON!! or additional cards to pay.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s015 (Legal actions)

`getLegalActions()` should return actions valid for the current game state and current pending decision.

```ts
function getLegalActions(state: GameState, playerId: PlayerId): LegalAction[] {
  if (state.pendingDecision) {
    return legalResponsesForDecision(state.pendingDecision, playerId, state);
  }

  return legalPhaseActions(state, playerId);
}
```

Legal actions sent to a client must not leak hidden information. For example, the opponent should not receive an action list that implies exactly which hidden counter cards exist.

### 04-effect-runtime.s003 (Effect categories)

| Category    | Runtime behavior                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto        | Detected from `EngineEvent`s and queued.                   |
| Activate    | Exposed through legal actions during valid timing windows. |
| Permanent   | Contributes continuous modifiers to computed view.         |
| Replacement | Intercepts replaceable processes before atomic mutation.   |

### 04-effect-runtime.s008 (Trigger detection from events)

Trigger detection consumes event batches.

```ts
function detectTriggeredEffects(
  state: GameState,
  events: EngineEvent[],
): TriggerCandidate[] {
  const candidates: TriggerCandidate[] = [];

  for (const event of events) {
    candidates.push(...findAutoEffectsForEvent(state, event));
    candidates.push(...findReplacementFollowupsIfAny(state, event));
  }

  return candidates.filter((c) => canTriggerNow(c, state));
}
```

The engine must check source presence before queueing, then apply the queue entry's source-presence policy before resolution.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 11-testing-quality.s007 (Interaction tests)

Representative interactions:

```

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only the support metadata gate and play-card legal action boundary for supported Main Events. Stop before changing payment execution, Event effect resolution, target-effect continuation, CLI, server, client, or UI behavior.

## Scope

- allow `implemented-dsl` Event support metadata only for a reviewed single `[Main]` Event effect definition inside the current supported runtime shape
- expose `playCard` legal actions for supported Main Events only to the controller during that player's Main Phase outside battle and when no pending decision or unresolved runtime work exists
- keep existing vanilla `[Main]` Event support behavior intact
- omit legal actions for unsupported Event status, missing implementation records, missing effect definitions, non-Event manifests, trigger text, Counter timing, optional effects, once-per-turn effects, effect costs, unresolved conditions, custom handlers, and unsupported effect bodies
- keep opponent legal actions and player-facing legal-action projection free of hidden support or hand-content leaks

## Out of Scope

- changing Event payment execution
- changing Event hand-to-trash movement
- resolving Event effects
- target selection decisions or target-effect continuation
- Counter Events
- Life Trigger changes
- replacement effects
- optional activation
- once-per-turn tracking
- custom handlers
- server/client/UI

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-038A packet while implementing this story
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify before implementation and review handoff
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-038 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- if legality depends on parsing unsupported printed text, broader support policy, target primitive resolution, or client-visible explanations, stop and split or record the blocker
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/play-card-event.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- supported implemented-dsl Main Event cards appear as legal play actions in the controller's valid Main Phase window
- the same cards are omitted for the opponent, outside Main Phase, during battle, or while a pending decision or runtime work blocks normal phase actions
- unsupported or ambiguous Event implementation metadata fails closed without adding legal actions
- existing vanilla Event legal-action coverage remains passing

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
