# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-014C
Epic ID: M1-001
Title: Apply Blocker selection and target redirection
Type: implementation
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Extend the Block Step decision to allow choosing one legal blocker, then rest that blocker, record it on battle state, redirect the current target, and emit `blockerActivated` without resolving damage yet.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s019 (Block Step)

1. Defender may activate one legal `[Blocker]`, unless blocking is prohibited.
2. Blocker rests and becomes the current target.
3. Emit `blockerActivated`.
4. Queue `[On Block]` effects.
5. Resolve the block timing window.
6. If attacker or current target left its zone or is no longer a legal battle participant, skip to End of Battle.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s020 (Counter Step)

1. Queue defender-side effects that trigger from being attacked or from the opponent's attack timing, such as `[On Your Opponent's Attack]`, before ordinary counter actions.
2. Resolve that timing window.
3. If attacker or current target left its zone or is no longer a legal battle participant, skip to End of Battle.
4. Defender may perform any number of legal counter actions:
   - Trash a Character card with counter value from hand for power.
   - Use a `[Counter]` Event by paying its cost and trashing it.
5. After each counter action and after the defender passes, re-check whether attacker and current target still exist and remain legal battle participants. If not, skip to End of Battle.
6. Proceed to Damage Step only if the attacker and current target are still legal.

The server must avoid timing leaks. If the defender has no legal counter actions and settings allow auto-pass, the window should auto-pass without revealing hidden details.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s021 (Damage Step)

1. Compute attacker and target power from `ComputedGameView`.
2. If attacker power is lower than target power, no damage/K.O. occurs.
3. If attacker power is equal or greater:
   - Target Leader: deal damage.
   - Target Character: K.O. target.
4. Emit events for damage, life movement, K.O., card movement.
5. Triggered effects during damage wait until damage processing completes.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s025 (Keyword behavior)

| Keyword         | Engine behavior                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rush            | Character may attack the turn it was played.                         |
| Rush: Character | Character may attack Characters, not Leader, the turn it was played. |
| Double Attack   | Leader damage count is 2.                                            |
| Banish          | Damaged life card is trashed; no normal trigger/hand path.           |
| Blocker         | During Block Step, can rest to redirect attack.                      |
| Unblockable     | Skips opponent blocker window.                                       |
| Activate: Main  | Legal only during controller's Main Phase outside battle.            |
| Main            | Event usable during controller's Main Phase.                         |
| Counter         | Event usable during opponent's Counter Step.                         |
| Once Per Turn   | Tracked by stable effect ID and card instance per turn.              |
| DON!! xX        | Condition is attached DON!! count greater than or equal to X.        |

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s003 (Base state vs. computed view)

Separate base facts from derived values.

Base state stores:

- Which cards are in which zones.
- Active/rested state.
- Attached DON!! cards.
- Turn, phase, battle sub-step.
- Effect durations and source references.
- Pending decisions.

Computed view derives:

- Current power.
- Current cost.
- Granted/removed keywords.
- Attack/block restrictions.
- Protection from K.O. or other processes.
- Replacement candidates.

```ts
interface ComputedGameView {
  seq: StateSeq;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  cards: Record<InstanceId, ComputedCardView>;
  legalAttackTargets: Record<InstanceId, InstanceId[]>;
  restrictions: RestrictionIndex;
}

interface ComputedCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  basePower?: number;
  currentPower?: number;
  baseCost?: number;
  currentCost?: number;
  keywords: Keyword[];
  canAttack: boolean;
  canBlock: boolean;
  cannotBeAttacked: boolean;
  protectedFrom: Protection[];
}
```

Do not persist derived current power as canonical state unless a rule explicitly changes a base value. Recompute from base state and continuous modifiers.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s004 (Engine result)

Every engine call returns a result object rather than only the new state.

```ts
interface EngineResult {
  state: GameState;
  events: EngineEvent[];
  decisions?: PendingDecision[];
  errors?: EngineError[];
  stateHash: string;
}
```

For normal play there should be at most one active `pendingDecision` at a time. Tests may use arrays to inspect internal generated decisions.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s009 (Pending decisions)

Effects, costs, target selection, optional activation, simultaneous trigger ordering, and life triggers all pause through the same model.

```ts
type PendingDecision =
  | ChooseTriggerOrderDecision
  | ChooseOptionalActivationDecision
  | PayCostDecision
  | SelectTargetsDecision
  | SelectCardsDecision
  | ChooseEffectOptionDecision
  | ConfirmLifeTriggerDecision
  | OrderCardsDecision
  | MulliganDecision
  | DeclareLoopCountDecision
  | RollbackConsentDecision;

interface BaseDecision {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  defaultResponse?: DecisionResponse;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s013 (Targets/cards)

```ts
interface SelectTargetsDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "selectTargets";
  request: TargetRequest;
  candidates: TargetCandidate[];
}

interface SelectCardsDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "selectCards";
  request: CardSelectionRequest;
  candidates: CardSelectionCandidate[];
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s016 (Action envelope inside the engine)

The server-facing protocol envelope is defined separately. The engine action should be pure data.

```ts
type Action =
  | { type: "playCard"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; costPayment?: PaymentSpec }
  | {
      type: "activateEffect";
      source: CardRef;
      effectId: string;
      costPayment?: PaymentSpec;
    }
  | { type: "attachDon"; donInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | {
      type: "respondToDecision";
      decisionId: string;
      response: DecisionResponse;
    };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s018 (Canonical event visibility)

Each `EngineEvent` has one visibility policy:

```text
public          safe for both players immediately
private         visible only to listed player IDs
replayOnly      hidden during live play but available in completed full replay
serverOnly      never leaves trusted server/runtime logs
```

Visibility is independent of replay determinism. Replay artifacts may store information that was never sent to either player during the live match.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s023 (Error handling inside the engine)

Engine errors are classified.

```ts
type EngineError =
  | { type: "illegalAction"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invalidDecisionResponse"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invariantViolation"; invariant: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "unsupportedCard"; cardId: CardId; status: CardSupportStatus }
  | { type: "effectRuntimeError"; effectId: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "loopDetected"; signature: LoopSignature };
```

Illegal player actions are rejected and logged. Invariant violations and effect runtime errors freeze or recover the match according to the recovery policy.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only blocker candidate exposure, blocker-selection response validation, activation mutation, and the activation event. Stop before resolving blocked-battle damage, Counter Step actions, On Block effects, Unblockable, replacement effects, or effect-runtime queueing.

## Scope

- extend the ENG-014B Block Step `selectCards` pending decision to expose exactly the currently legal active defender-controlled printed Blocker candidates with `min: 0` and `max: 1`
- accept blocker selection only through `respondToDecision` for the defender-owned Block Step pending decision
- leave raw `activateBlocker` phase actions unsupported unless they are internally reused behind the decision response
- validate the selected CardRef reifies to an active defender-controlled Character with printed `blocker` and `canBlock: true`
- rest the blocker, set `battle.blocker`, redirect `battle.currentTarget` to the blocker, clear the pending decision, and emit public `blockerActivated`
- keep `battle.originalTarget` unchanged for replay/debugging
- after accepted activation, leave battle active at `battle.step: "block"` for ENG-014D to resolve rather than silently skipping Counter/On Block timing
- reject stale, rested, non-Blocker, attacker-controlled, already-used, wrong-step, no-battle, pending runtime, replacement-state, unsupported metadata, and forged/multi-card selection cases without mutation or events

## Out of Scope

- resolving damage against the blocker
- auto-skipping Counter Step or implementing Counter actions
- On Block effect queueing
- Unblockable, replacement, protection, effect-runtime queueing, replay schema, CLI/server/client behavior

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/actions.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/actions.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/action-test-fixtures.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions-test-fixtures.ts

## Constraints

- create the ENG-014C substory branch from the approved ENG-014 parent integration branch and open the ENG-014C PR against that parent branch after human approval of the parent workflow
- do not resolve blocked-battle damage in this story
- fail closed on ambiguous timing, hidden information, or source-presence behavior
- keep engine-core deterministic and pure
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- unit test for successful blocker selection response mutation and exact `decisionResolved` plus `blockerActivated` event payloads
- unit test proving original target remains unchanged while current target becomes blocker
- unit test asserting no step advancement, no pending decision, no effect queue, no battle clearing, no damage events, and stable state hash after accepted activation
- unit tests proving stale, rested, non-Blocker, attacker-controlled, wrong-step, already-blocked, forged, multi-card, wrong-decision, and no-battle activations reject without mutation
- unit tests proving pending runtime work, replacement state, Unblockable, Double Attack/Banish unsupported combinations, unsupported support metadata, and missing support metadata reject without mutation
- `corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/actions.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts` must pass
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck` must pass
- `corepack pnpm run verify` must pass

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- valid blocker response rests the blocker and redirects `battle.currentTarget`
- accepted activation records `battle.blocker`, preserves `battle.originalTarget`, clears pending decision, and leaves `battle.step: "block"`
- accepted activation emits public `decisionResolved` and exactly one public `blockerActivated` event with deterministic payloads, event sequence, visibility, and state hash
- invalid blocker activations reject without mutation or events
- no damage, K.O., Life movement, battle clearing, pending queue creation, or step advancement occurs in this story
