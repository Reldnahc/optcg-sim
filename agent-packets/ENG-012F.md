# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-012F
Epic ID: M1-001
Title: Integrate no-choice On Play draw with play-card
Type: implementation
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Wire the supported no-choice On Play draw runtime vertical into accepted Character play so M2-001 is proven through the public battle-neutral engine action surface.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s003 (Rule-processing checkpoints)

Run rule processing after every atomic state change, not only after player actions.

```ts
function afterAtomicMutation(result: EngineStepResult): EngineStepResult {
  const checked = checkRuleProcessing(result.state);
  return { ...result, state: checked };
}
```

Rule processing checks:

- Leader damage when that player has 0 life.
- Deck-out at a rule-processing checkpoint.
- Effect-created win/loss conditions.
- Simultaneous loss resulting in draw.
- Invariant violations in development/test mode.

Concession is immediate and cannot be replaced or prevented.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s016 (Playing a card)

Playing a card from hand is a structured action:

```text
1. Reveal card from hand.
2. Compute total cost from base cost plus continuous cost modifiers.
3. Clamp final negative cost to 0.
4. Select required active DON!! in cost area.
5. Rest selected DON!!.
6. If playing a Character while character area is full, choose and trash one existing Character by rule process; no triggers.
7. If playing a Stage while stage area is full, trash existing Stage.
8. Place card in destination or trash Event before resolving Event effect.
9. Emit cardPlayed/cardMoved events.
10. Detect and queue [On Play] or Event effects as appropriate.
```

Cost payment should be represented as a `PendingDecision` if the player must choose exactly which DON!! or additional cards to pay.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s004 (Engine result)

Every engine call returns a result object rather than only the new state.

```ts
interface EngineResult {
  state: GameState;
  events: EngineEvent[];
  decisions?: PendingDecision[];
  errors?: EngineError[];
  stateHash: string;
}
```

For normal play there should be at most one active `pendingDecision` at a time. Tests may use arrays to inspect internal generated decisions.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s015 (Legal actions)

`getLegalActions()` should return actions valid for the current game state and current pending decision.

```ts
function getLegalActions(state: GameState, playerId: PlayerId): LegalAction[] {
  if (state.pendingDecision) {
    return legalResponsesForDecision(state.pendingDecision, playerId, state);
  }

  return legalPhaseActions(state, playerId);
}
```

Legal actions sent to a client must not leak hidden information. For example, the opponent should not receive an action list that implies exactly which hidden counter cards exist.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 04-effect-runtime.s008 (Trigger detection from events)

Trigger detection consumes event batches.

```ts
function detectTriggeredEffects(
  state: GameState,
  events: EngineEvent[],
): TriggerCandidate[] {
  const candidates: TriggerCandidate[] = [];

  for (const event of events) {
    candidates.push(...findAutoEffectsForEvent(state, event));
    candidates.push(...findReplacementFollowupsIfAny(state, event));
  }

  return candidates.filter((c) => canTriggerNow(c, state));
}
```

The engine must check source presence before queueing, then apply the queue entry's source-presence policy before resolution.

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s004 (Effect block)

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string;
  category: "auto" | "activate" | "permanent" | "replacement";
  trigger: Trigger;
  condition?: Condition;
  conditionTiming?: "activation" | "resolution" | "both";
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s005 (Triggers)

```ts
type Trigger =
  | { type: "onPlay" }
  | { type: "whenAttacking" }

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s029 (Schema coverage policy)

`contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` is the executable JSON fixture contract.
TypeScript/spec primitives outside that JSON schema are planned/not
fixture-authorable until schema validation and fixtures exist.

Schema-supported fixture subset:

- trigger: onPlay
- trigger: whenAttacking
- trigger: onOpponentAttack
- trigger: onBlock
- trigger: onKO
- trigger: endOfYourTurn
- trigger: endOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: trigger
- trigger: activateMain
- trigger: main
- trigger: counter
- trigger: permanent
- trigger: startOfGame
- trigger: startOfYourTurn
- trigger: startOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: startOfMainPhase
- trigger: endOfBattle
- trigger: donAttach
- trigger: custom
- condition: yourTurn
- condition: attachedDonCount
- cost: restDon
- cost: restSelf
- cost: sequence
- target: self, myLeader, opponentLeader, attacker, attackTarget, blocker,
  triggerCard, all, choose
- duration: thisAction, thisBattle, thisTurn, whileSourceOnField, permanent
- effect: draw
- effect: ko
- effect: modifyPower
- effect: sequence
- effect: custom
- card filters: cardIds, names, nameContains, nameNot, categories, colorsAny,
  colorsAll, typesAny, typesAll, attributesAny, attributesAll, cost, power,
  counter, hasKeywords, lacksKeywords, state, owner, controller, excludeSelf,
  custom

Planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage exists:

- condition: donCount
- condition: opponentTurn
- condition: lifeCount
- condition: fieldCount
- condition: handCount
- condition: trashCount
- condition: hasCardInZone
- condition: attackTarget
- condition: cardState
- condition: sourceStillInZone
- condition: eventPayload
- condition: and, or, not, custom
- cost: returnDon
- cost: trashFromHand
- cost: trashSelf
- cost: trashFromField
- cost: discard
- cost: chooseOne
- cost: custom
- duration: untilEndOfTurn
- duration: untilStartOfNextTurn
- duration: whileConditionTrue
- effect: drawUpTo
- effect: search
- effect: lookAtTop
- effect: revealFromZone
- effect: revealTop
- effect: selectFromSet
- effect: selectCards
- effect: moveSelected with position
- effect: putRemaining
- effect: shuffleDeck
- effect: bounce
- effect: trash
- effect: play
- effect: playSelected
- effect: returnUnselectedToDeck
- effect: trashFromHand
- effect: setPowerToZero
- effect: setBasePower
- effect: modifyCost
- effect: setBaseCost
- effect: rest
- effect: activate

- effect: returnDon
- effect: addLife
- effect: damage
- effect: invalidateEffects
- effect: protectFromKO
- effect: cannotAttack
- effect: cannotBlock
- effect: cannotBeAttacked
- effect: cannotBeBlockedBy
- effect: choice
- effect: conditional
- effect: forEachMatch
- effect: repeat
- effect: replacement

new fixture-authorable primitives must add schema coverage and validation fixtures in the same story that makes the primitive authorable.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 18-acceptance-tests.s004 (Milestone 2 - first effect runtime)

```text
M2-001 On Play draw queues and resolves
M2-002 When Attacking effect resolves before defender On Opponent Attack window
M2-003 blocker redirects attack and emits blockerActivated
M2-004 counter character grants battle power until end of battle
M2-005 counter event is trashed and effect resolves
M2-006 On K.O. activates on field and resolves from trash or last known info
M2-007 life Trigger resolves from no zone then moves to trash unless replaced
M2-008 simultaneous triggers controlled by same player require order decision
M2-009 turn player effect A, opponent effect B, new turn-player effect C resolves A-B-C
M2-010 damage-processing triggers wait until all damage points complete
M2-011 continuous +1000 modifier does not mutate base state
M2-012 replacement effect applies once per process
M2-013 optional effect creates chooseOptionalActivation decision
M2-014 target selection respects visibility and legal candidates
M2-015 unsupported non-vanilla card is rejected outside dev sandbox
M2-016 once-per-turn failed cost does not consume use
M2-017 once-per-turn committed effect that later fizzles still consumes use
M2-018 defender on-opponent-attack effects resolve before ordinary counter actions
M2-019 post-counter missing attacker or target skips Damage Step
M2-020 replacement choice uses chooseReplacement decision and logs replacementApplied
M2-021 replacement cannot apply twice to same process
M2-022 transient revealed card returned face-down is removed from opponent view
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only play-card integration for no-choice `[On Play] Draw N` on supported `implemented-dsl` Character cards. Stop before Event effect execution, optional/choice effects, target selection, trigger ordering decisions, battle timing windows, replacements, continuous effects, or CLI/server/client changes.

## Scope

- after accepted Character play emits `cardPlayed`, detect and queue supported no-choice On Play draw effects
- resolve the supported no-choice queue before returning Main Phase action priority
- include draw/effect events in the same accepted engine result in deterministic order after play events
- preserve legal-action omission/rejection for unsupported effect definitions, choice-requiring On Play effects, Event effects, custom handlers, and unresolved runtime work
- preserve existing vanilla Character/Stage/Event play behavior when no supported On Play draw effect is present

## Out of Scope

- Event `[Main]` effect execution
- `[Counter]` Event timing
- optional effects
- chooseTriggerOrder, chooseOptionalActivation, target selection, or replacement decisions
- When Attacking, On Opponent Attack, On K.O., life Trigger, blocker, counter, continuous effects, once-per-turn tracking
- CLI/server/client/replay schema changes

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/play-card.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/play-card.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/play-card-legal-actions.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/play-card-support.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/play-card-test-fixtures.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime.test.ts

## Constraints

- do not silently execute unsupported effect shapes
- fail closed on timing-window, hidden-information, replay, or source-presence ambiguity
- keep engine-core deterministic and pure
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- unit test proving `applyPlayCard` for `[On Play] Draw 1` mutates hand/deck/field as expected
- unit test asserting deterministic event order for card play followed by On Play draw resolution
- unit test proving legal actions expose supported On Play draw Character play but omit/reject unsupported effect definitions
- unit tests proving choice-requiring, optional, custom, Event, and unsupported On Play effects fail closed without partial mutation
- existing vanilla play-card tests must pass without weakened assertions
- `corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/play-card.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime.test.ts` must pass
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck` must pass
- `corepack pnpm run verify` must pass

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- playing a supported Character with `[On Play] Draw 1` queues and resolves the draw through `applyPlayCard`
- returned events include play events, effect queue/resolution events, and draw events in stable order
- deck/hand changes reflect the draw after the played card leaves hand
- unsupported effect definitions and choice-requiring On Play effects still fail closed without partial mutation
- vanilla no-effect play behavior remains unchanged

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
