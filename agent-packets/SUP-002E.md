## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 01-system-architecture.s023 (Poneglyph-centered card-data topology)

Poneglyph is external display/metadata truth. The simulator is gameplay truth.

```text
Poneglyph API
  -> @optcg/cards fetches and validates with Zod
  -> Redis read-through cache stores validated Poneglyph metadata
  -> certified parser rules may generate complete parsed effect definitions
  -> runtime capability matrix gates generated support status
  -> simulator overlay adds reviewed custom behavior, rulings, banlist status, and explicit overrides
  -> match server snapshots resolved cards at match creation
  -> engine consumes the match card manifest and effect registry
```

Important boundaries:

- The match server never trusts Poneglyph data supplied by the client.
- The client may fetch Poneglyph data for images/search/display only.
- The server validates every Poneglyph response before use.
- Simulator overlays are keyed by Poneglyph card ID.
- Common-template support is generated from complete parse plus runtime capability checks, not from a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map.
- Generated support records are fail-closed: any unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or capability-missing component keeps the card unsupported in normal play.
- Poneglyph variant indexes/generated variant keys are cosmetic and stored in deck data, not rule state.

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

### 04-effect-runtime.s007 (Source presence policy)

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

Optionality has three distinct meanings:

- Optional activation asks whether the player commits to resolving the effect block. Declining optional activation means the effect block is not legally committed and once-per-turn usage is not consumed.
- Optional cost asks whether the player pays a non-mandatory cost inside an otherwise committed effect. Declining or failing an optional cost records `paidCost: false` and only skips later instructions whose connector or text depends on that cost being paid.
- Optional effect clause asks whether the player performs a non-mandatory instruction during resolution. Declining an optional effect clause records `playerDeclined: true` for that segment and does not undo prior legally completed segments.

Optional cost clauses inside composed execution are not effect-block activation
costs. They occur after legal commitment to the effect block, inside a
resumable sequence segment. Optional cost accept, decline, and failure do not
consume once-per-turn usage because usage was consumed at legal commitment
before the optional cost clause executes. Accepted optional costs pay cost
atomically and emit the normal cost-payment events. Declined optional costs do
not emit cost-payment events. Failed optional costs emit no public event that
reveals hidden payment candidates or private payment details.

Accepted optional cost records `attempted: true`, `succeeded: true`,
`paidCost: true`, and `playerDeclined: false`; `changedState` records whether
canonical state actually changed. Declined optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: true`. Failed optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: false`. Optional cost accept, decline,
and failure do not consume once-per-turn usage, and dependent connectors use
`paidCost` rather than optional-activation state.
Event `seq` values and `state.seq` advancement remain deterministic for
optional cost accept, decline, and failure. State hashes include the frame
segment result for each branch.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s003 (Top-level definition)

```ts
interface EffectDefinition {
  cardId: CardId;
  implementationStatus: CardSupportStatus;
  effects: EffectBlock[];
  metadata: EffectDefinitionMetadata;
}

interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  sourceTextHash: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  tested: boolean;
  reviewer?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s004 (Effect block)

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string;
  category: "auto" | "activate" | "permanent" | "replacement";
  trigger: Trigger;
  condition?: Condition;
  conditionTiming?: "activation" | "resolution" | "both";
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s006 (Conditions)

```ts
type Condition =
  | { type: "donCount"; target?: Target; min: number }
  | { type: "yourTurn" }
  | { type: "opponentTurn" }
  | { type: "lifeCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "fieldCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "handCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "trashCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "leaderColorCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "hasCardInZone"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter: CardFilter }
  | { type: "attackTarget"; targetType: "leader" | "character" | "any" }
  | { type: "cardState"; target: Target; state: "active" | "rested" }
  | { type: "sourceStillInZone" }
  | { type: "eventPayload"; path: string; op: Comparator; value: unknown }
  | { type: "and"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "or"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "not"; condition: Condition }
  | { type: "custom"; check: string };

type Comparator = "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte";
type PlayerRef =
  | "self"
  | "opponent"
  | "turnPlayer"
  | "nonTurnPlayer"
  | "owner"
  | "controller";
```

`leaderColorCount` is a public Leader metadata condition. It reads only the
player's Leader colors from the match manifest or resolved card snapshot, uses a
canonical `PlayerRef` and `Comparator`, and its `value` is a non-negative safe
integer. Printed "multicolored" Leader conditions map to
`{ type: "leaderColorCount", player: "self", op: "gte", value: 2 }`.

Leader type and Leader attribute conditions do not introduce `leaderType` or
`leaderAttribute` predicates. Represent them through the public Leader Area with
`hasCardInZone` and `CardFilter`, for example
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], typesAny: ["Straw Hat Crew"] } }`
or
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], attributesAny: ["slash"] } }`.
The schema-supported fixture subset admits only this public Leader-zone metadata
form and does not authorize private-zone metadata queries.

Condition, duration, and restriction primitives outside the schema-supported fixture subset remain planned layers. They are contract-defined by this reference, but they are not fixture-authorable until the schema coverage policy lists them as supported.

For public DON-on-field count authorability, use existing `fieldCount` with a
DON filter (`filter.categories` containing `"don"`), canonical comparator, and
non-negative threshold. In this DON filter form, schema fixtures support
`player: "self"` and `player: "opponent"` only, and reject free-text shortcuts.
This is contract/schema authorability evidence only and does not by itself imply
runtime executable support, parser certification, generated support, or card
playability.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s007 (Costs)

```ts
type Cost =
  | { type: "restDon"; count: number; chooser?: PlayerRef }
  | { type: "returnDon"; count: number; chooser?: PlayerRef }
  | { type: "restSelf" }
  | {
      type: "trashFromHand";
      count: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
    }
  | { type: "trashSelf" }
  | {
      type: "trashFromField";
      count: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
    }
  | { type: "discard"; count: number; filter?: CardFilter; chooser: PlayerRef }
  | { type: "sequence"; costs: Cost[] }
  | { type: "chooseOne"; options: Cost[] }
  | { type: "custom"; action: string };

type OptionalCost =
  | { type: "restDon"; count: number; chooser?: PlayerRef; optional: true }
  | { type: "returnDon"; count: number; chooser?: PlayerRef; optional: true }
  | { type: "restSelf"; optional: true }
  | {
      type: "trashFromHand";
      count: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
      optional: true;
    }
  | { type: "sequence"; costs: Cost[]; optional: true };
```

If paying a cost requires choosing cards or DON!!, the runtime creates a `PayCostDecision`.
Cost primitives outside the schema-supported fixture subset remain planned layers. Optional cost behavior must remain separate from optional activation and optional effect clauses as defined by `04-effect-runtime.s011`.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s012 (Effects)

type Effect =
  // Card movement

```

Cardinality fields such as `min` and `max` use the exact-N and up-to-N semantics from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`. `drawUpTo` is a planned `chooseQuantity`-backed primitive: it must pause through a `chooseQuantity` pending decision, validate the selected whole integer against public min/max bounds, and draw only the chosen amount when a future runtime story makes it executable.

`drawUpTo` short-deck resolution is do-as-much-as-possible. If the chosen quantity is greater than the number of cards remaining in that player's deck, the runtime must draw every remaining card and emit draw and card-movement events only for cards actually drawn. The next rule-processing checkpoint detects deck-out under `02-engine-mechanics.s035`; the effect does not fail closed before drawing the remaining cards solely because the chosen quantity exceeded the remaining deck size.

Event `seq` values for partial-deck drawUpTo resolution must remain strictly increasing by append order, as required by `03-game-state-events-decisions.s005`. The resolved decision increments `state.seq` once under `03-game-state-events-decisions.s022`; individual draw events do not each advance `state.seq`. State hashes at the replay checkpoints include the post-draw empty deck. Golden replay coverage for drawUpTo short-deck cases must pin the final state hash.

Duration and restriction effects such as `cannotAttack`, `cannotBlock`, `cannotBeAttacked`, `cannotBeBlockedBy`, `invalidateEffects`, and `protectFromKO` remain planned unless the schema coverage policy lists them as schema-supported and the runtime capability matrix proves the active engine can enforce the restriction for the full duration.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  generatedSupportId?: string;
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted. For common templates, implementation may come from a generated support index entry instead of a manual per-card overlay when the complete parse, parser certification, and runtime capability checks all pass.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s012 (Deck validation)

Deck validation resolves and validates against Poneglyph IDs, Poneglyph legality records, and simulator support metadata. Poneglyph is the canonical external source for format/card legality inputs such as legal status, bans, and copy limits; the simulator may only layer unsupported-card policy or platform-specific constraints on top.

Generated support index output is simulator support metadata. Deck validation may treat a generated record as `implemented-dsl` or `implemented-custom` only when the record has complete parse evidence, current source/behavior hashes, certified parser-rule evidence, and a runtime capability matrix result proving every component is supported.

```ts
interface DeckValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: DeckValidationError[];
  warnings: DeckValidationWarning[];
  resolvedCards: ResolvedDeckCard[];
  versions: {
    cardDataVersion: string;
    effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
    overlayVersion: string;
    banlistVersion: string;
  };
}
```

Validation checks:

- Leader count and leader identity.
- Main deck size.
- DON!! deck size.
- Leader/color restrictions.
- Per-card copy limits by Poneglyph base `cardId`.
- Official format restrictions.
- Simulator-specific bans.
- Unsupported-card status.
- Variant IDs resolve to valid Poneglyph variants for the base card.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s014 (Canonical Poneglyph normalization)

The Poneglyph adapter emits `ResolvedCard` from `contracts/canonical-types.ts`. Important normalization rules:

- `attribute` values become `attributes: Attribute[]`; never collapse to a singular attribute.
- `color` values become `colors: CardColor[]`; multi-color cards preserve all colors.
- `variants[].index` becomes `variantIndex`.
- `variantKey = `${cardId}:v${variantIndex}``.
- Missing market prices, product set codes, or image URLs are allowed display gaps and must not fail gameplay resolution.
- Search endpoint DTOs are never accepted as manifest card details. Only detail/batch card payloads can become `ResolvedCard`.
- `sourceTextHash` covers printed effect/trigger text used for implementation drift.
- `behaviorHash` covers stats, type line, effect, trigger, official FAQ, errata, and any source field that can alter behavior.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s018 (Effect coverage report)

Generate this in CI from Poneglyph total cards plus simulator overlay status.

```text
Total cards in Poneglyph:      2347
Vanilla confirmed:              420
DSL implemented:               1530
Custom implemented:              73
Unsupported:                    324
Banned in simulator:              0
Implemented cards tested:      1603 / 1603
Cards with stale text hash:       12
```

Primitive usage report:

```text
draw:              321
ko:                118
search:             94
modifyPower:       402
replacement:        27
custom handler:     73
```

High repeated custom-handler usage suggests the DSL is missing primitives.

Effect coverage and primitive usage reports are progress evidence only. They must not promote partial, stale, ambiguous, unparsed, unsupported, or capability-missing generated support into playable normal-mode support.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s024 (Source hash and behavior hash)

Use both hashes:

```ts
interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId;
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // effect + trigger text only
  behaviorHash: string; // stats + type line + effect + trigger + FAQ + errata
  notes?: string;
}
```

`OP01-060` demonstrates why `behaviorHash` matters: the FAQ clarifies that an unplayed revealed card returns to the top of the deck face-down. A change to that FAQ would affect hidden-information behavior even if the printed effect text did not change.

### 11-testing-quality.s020 (Poneglyph/card-data tests)

Add card-data tests once `@optcg/cards` exists:

```text
CD-001 Poneglyph response validates against Zod schema
CD-002 invalid Poneglyph shape fails before Redis cache write
CD-003 Redis cache key includes cardDataVersion and overlay/effect version
CD-004 overlay merge adds support status and effect definition IDs
CD-005 Poneglyph source text hash drift marks implementation stale
CD-006 unsupported non-vanilla Poneglyph card cannot enter ranked deck
CD-007 variant indexes/generated variant keys are accepted only when valid for the base card
CD-008 client display data cannot alter server-resolved match manifest
CD-009 generated support index accepts only complete-parse cards whose every parsed component is covered by the runtime capability matrix
CD-010 partial, ambiguous, stale, unparsed, unsupported, or capability-missing generated support reports do not make cards playable in normal modes
CD-011 certified parser-rule fixtures auto-support matching complete-parse common-template cards without a manual per-card allowlist
```

These tests prevent the card-data layer from becoming an implicit rules authority.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Cards-layer story only. Contract/schema prerequisites must already be implemented by SUP-002A and runtime prerequisites must already be implemented by SUP-002B. Do not add new engine runtime behavior, shared contract/schema changes, real-card fixture promotion, source hashes, behavior hashes, overlays, or card-specific branches.

## Scope

- define parser primitives separately before composing them: `[On Play]` trigger wrapper, optional hand-trash cost wrapper, K.O. verb, up-to-one opponent Character target, base-cost maximum predicate, saved-target K.O. consumer, and sequence connectors
- parse `[On Play]` timing with `You may trash N card(s) from your hand:` as an optional cost wrapper
- compose the optional cost wrapper with target selection and K.O. body primitives
- parse `K.O. up to 1 of your opponent's Characters with a base cost of N or less` into reusable target filter and K.O. sequence data
- vary cost count and base-cost threshold in tests to prevent exact sentence matching while target maximum remains one
- add runtime capability matrix evidence that cites SUP-002A and SUP-002B capability groups

## Out of Scope

- engine runtime behavior or shared contract/schema changes
- real-card fixture capture, source hash updates, behavior hash updates, overlays, supported-card manifests, or cards-produced manifests
- exact card IDs, exact full-card text, external card lists, or one-off full-effect branches
- optional trash-from-hand filters, discard aliases, alternate zones, multiple target destinations, or K.O. conditions beyond base-cost threshold
- broad natural-language parsing for every "you may" clause

## Constraints

- implement only SUP-002E while its packet is active
- do not activate or implement SUP-002E until SUP-002A contract/schema evidence and SUP-002B runtime capability evidence have landed as reviewed prerequisite evidence on the active parent integration branch
- stop and split if implementation requires new engine runtime behavior
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- cards parser test for optional hand-trash cost wrapper alone as a reusable component
- cards parser residue/composition test proving the opponent Character target and base-cost maximum predicate are not inseparable from the optional-cost wrapper
- cards parser residue/composition test proving the saved-target K.O. consumer and connector compose with a previously selected target without reparsing one full representative sentence
- cards parser/generated-support test for optional hand-trash cost into filtered K.O.
- real-schema generated-support regression for the representative optional-trash K.O. line
- fail-closed generated-support test when parser-rule certification evidence is absent or stale for any required optional-cost, target-filter, saved-target K.O., or composition component
- test varying numeric count and base-cost threshold
- fail-closed tests for unsupported optional cost body fragments and unsupported target filters
- runtime capability matrix test for SUP-002B capability evidence
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/cards test`
- `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- parser/generator support is generic over hand-trash count and base-cost threshold while target maximum remains one
- parser/generator implementation must expose or test the optional-cost wrapper, target filter/base-cost predicate, and saved-target K.O. consumer independently; a single full-sentence regex that only proves the representative line fails this story even if count and threshold vary
- generated-support tests that assert `status: supported` must validate the produced Effect DSL with the real schema validator
- generated-support promotion requires current parser-rule certification evidence for the optional-cost wrapper, target filter/base-cost predicate, saved-target K.O. consumer, and their composition; absent or stale certification evidence must fail closed even when DSL schema validation and runtime capability checks pass
- generated support fails closed when the optional cost or target/K.O. body is only partially parsed
- runtime capability evidence is required before final playable/generated-support decision can pass
- no production code checks exact full effect text, card IDs, or the representative sample as a whole string
