# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: SUP-001D
Epic ID: SUP-001
Title: DON-minus draw generated support
Type: implementation
Area: cards
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Compose the reusable DON-minus cost wrapper with existing On Play draw generated-support primitives so synthetic text such as `[On Play] DON!! -1: Draw 1 card.` can become supported only through the full generated-support gate chain.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s036 (DON!! card mechanics)

- Each DON!! attached to a Leader or Character grants +1000 power during the controller's turn only.
- During Main Phase, a player may give any number of active DON!! from cost area to their Leader or Characters.
- An attached DON!! card has `state: "attached"`; it is neither active nor rested while attached.
- When a card with attached DON!! leaves the field, all attached DON!! return to the owner's cost area rested.
- During Refresh Phase, all attached DON!! return to cost area rested, then the player's Leader, Characters, Stage, and DON!! in cost area become active.
- A `DON!! -X` cost may return the paying player's DON!! from cost area, attached to their Leader, or attached to their Characters unless the card text narrows the source. The paying player chooses the DON!! sources. If there are fewer than X eligible DON!! cards, the cost cannot be paid and the activation is illegal or declined before use is consumed.

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

### 04-effect-runtime.s007 (Source presence policy)

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

Optionality has three distinct meanings:

- Optional activation asks whether the player commits to resolving the effect block. Declining optional activation means the effect block is not legally committed and once-per-turn usage is not consumed.
- Optional cost asks whether the player pays a non-mandatory cost inside an otherwise committed effect. Declining or failing an optional cost records `paidCost: false` and only skips later instructions whose connector or text depends on that cost being paid.
- Optional effect clause asks whether the player performs a non-mandatory instruction during resolution. Declining an optional effect clause records `playerDeclined: true` for that segment and does not undo prior legally completed segments.

Optional cost clauses inside composed execution are not effect-block activation
costs. They occur after legal commitment to the effect block, inside a
resumable sequence segment. Optional cost accept, decline, and failure do not
consume once-per-turn usage because usage was consumed at legal commitment
before the optional cost clause executes. Accepted optional costs pay cost
atomically and emit the normal cost-payment events. Declined optional costs do
not emit cost-payment events. Failed optional costs emit no public event that
reveals hidden payment candidates or private payment details.

Accepted optional cost records `attempted: true`, `succeeded: true`,
`paidCost: true`, and `playerDeclined: false`; `changedState` records whether
canonical state actually changed. Declined optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: true`. Failed optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: false`. Optional cost accept, decline,
and failure do not consume once-per-turn usage, and dependent connectors use
`paidCost` rather than optional-activation state.
Event `seq` values and `state.seq` advancement remain deterministic for
optional cost accept, decline, and failure. State hashes include the frame
segment result for each branch.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

```

Cardinality fields such as `min` and `max` use the exact-N and up-to-N semantics from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`. `drawUpTo` is a planned `chooseQuantity`-backed primitive: it must pause through a `chooseQuantity` pending decision, validate the selected whole integer against public min/max bounds, and draw only the chosen amount when a future runtime story makes it executable.

`drawUpTo` short-deck resolution is do-as-much-as-possible. If the chosen quantity is greater than the number of cards remaining in that player's deck, the runtime must draw every remaining card and emit draw and card-movement events only for cards actually drawn. The next rule-processing checkpoint detects deck-out under `02-engine-mechanics.s035`; the effect does not fail closed before drawing the remaining cards solely because the chosen quantity exceeded the remaining deck size.

Event `seq` values for partial-deck drawUpTo resolution must remain strictly increasing by append order, as required by `03-game-state-events-decisions.s005`. The resolved decision increments `state.seq` once under `03-game-state-events-decisions.s022`; individual draw events do not each advance `state.seq`. State hashes at the replay checkpoints include the post-draw empty deck. Golden replay coverage for drawUpTo short-deck cases must pin the final state hash.

Duration and restriction effects such as `cannotAttack`, `cannotBlock`, `cannotBeAttacked`, `cannotBeBlockedBy`, `invalidateEffects`, and `protectFromKO` remain planned unless the schema coverage policy lists them as schema-supported and the runtime capability matrix proves the active engine can enforce the restriction for the full duration.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s024 (Source hash and behavior hash)

Use both hashes:

```ts
interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId;
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // effect + trigger text only
  behaviorHash: string; // stats + type line + effect + trigger + FAQ + errata
  notes?: string;
}
```

`OP01-060` demonstrates why `behaviorHash` matters: the FAQ clarifies that an unplayed revealed card returns to the top of the deck face-down. A change to that FAQ would affect hidden-information behavior even if the printed effect text did not change.

### 11-testing-quality.s020 (Poneglyph/card-data tests)

Add card-data tests once `@optcg/cards` exists:

```text
CD-001 Poneglyph response validates against Zod schema
CD-002 invalid Poneglyph shape fails before Redis cache write
CD-003 Redis cache key includes cardDataVersion and overlay/effect version
CD-004 overlay merge adds support status and effect definition IDs
CD-005 Poneglyph source text hash drift marks implementation stale
CD-006 unsupported non-vanilla Poneglyph card cannot enter ranked deck
CD-007 variant indexes/generated variant keys are accepted only when valid for the base card
CD-008 client display data cannot alter server-resolved match manifest
CD-009 generated support index accepts only complete-parse cards whose every parsed component is covered by the runtime capability matrix
CD-010 partial, ambiguous, stale, unparsed, unsupported, or capability-missing generated support reports do not make cards playable in normal modes
CD-011 certified parser-rule fixtures auto-support matching complete-parse common-template cards without a manual per-card allowlist
```

These tests prevent the card-data layer from becoming an implicit rules authority.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only cards-layer composition, parser-rule evidence, runtime capability gating, support-probe/report output, and synthetic tests for DON-minus draw. Do not add engine runtime behavior, shared contract/schema authority, real-card fixtures, source hashes, behavior hashes, overlays, support manifests, or support for the conditional When Attacking power line.

## Scope

- compose `[On Play]` trigger, DON-minus cost wrapper, and `Draw N card(s)` body into a schema-valid auto EffectBlock
- support positive safe-integer DON counts and draw counts generically where existing draw primitives allow them
- require source presence, return-DON cost, draw, parser certification, component evidence, runtime capability evidence, support metadata, review state, and tested state gates
- preserve fail-closed diagnostics for malformed cost, unsupported draw count, unsupported wrapper, stale hashes, missing metadata, missing review, missing tested-state, and missing runtime capability
- prove the path with synthetic inputs only

## Out of Scope

- engine runtime behavior for return-DON or draw
- shared contract/schema changes
- conditional When Attacking power modifier support
- real-card fixtures, source hashes, behavior hashes, overlays, support manifests, or cards-produced manifests
- exact full-card text branches or one real card

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/cards/src/**
- stories/generated/SUP-001*.yaml
- stories/approved/SUP-001*.yaml
- agent-packets/SUP-001D.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- generate and activate the SUP-001D packet before implementation
- do not activate SUP-001D until SUP-001C has merged
- stay within allowed touch points
- do not add engine runtime behavior or shared contract/schema authority
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- story-review for SUP-001D before approval handoff
- synthetic generated-support-index test for DON-minus On Play draw support
- support-probe/report certificate test proving every gate reports passed for the complete synthetic case
- negative tests for malformed cost, unsupported draw body, missing runtime capability, stale source hash, stale behavior hash, missing metadata, missing review, and missing tested-state gates
- regression tests for existing draw and return-DON generated-support paths
- production-code search or lint-style assertion proving no real-card ID branch, exact full-card branch, exact full-effect branch, or sample-specific sentence template
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/cards test`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- synthetic DON-minus On Play draw text produces complete generated support when all gates pass
- generated EffectDefinition contains a costed On Play draw block with stable effect identity and correct source presence policy
- parser-rule IDs, component evidence IDs, runtime capability IDs, schema validation, metadata, review, and tested-state gates report passed for the complete synthetic case
- stale sourceTextHash, stale behaviorHash, and missing runtime-capability evidence all keep the synthetic case non-playable
- malformed cost and unsupported body variants remain non-playable with narrow diagnostics
- existing On Play draw and return-DON play-selected generated-support behavior remains compatible
