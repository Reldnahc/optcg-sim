# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-019C
Epic ID: M1-001
Title: Keep Counter Events fail closed
Type: implementation
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Preserve deterministic fail-closed handling for `[Counter]` Events during the supported Counter Step slice so event cards are not silently skipped or resolved before event-counter support exists.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s020 (Counter Step)

1. Queue defender-side effects that trigger from being attacked or from the opponent's attack timing, such as `[On Your Opponent's Attack]`, before ordinary counter actions.
2. Resolve that timing window.
3. If attacker or current target left its zone or is no longer a legal battle participant, skip to End of Battle.
4. Defender may perform any number of legal counter actions:
   - Trash a Character card with counter value from hand for power.
   - Use a `[Counter]` Event by paying its cost and trashing it.
5. After each counter action and after the defender passes, re-check whether attacker and current target still exist and remain legal battle participants. If not, skip to End of Battle.
6. Proceed to Damage Step only if the attacker and current target are still legal.

The server must avoid timing leaks. If the defender has no legal counter actions and settings allow auto-pass, the window should auto-pass without revealing hidden details.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s004 (Engine result)

Every engine call returns a result object rather than only the new state.

```ts
interface EngineResult {
  state: GameState;
  events: EngineEvent[];
  decisions?: PendingDecision[];
  errors?: EngineError[];
  stateHash: string;
}
```

For normal play there should be at most one active `pendingDecision` at a time. Tests may use arrays to inspect internal generated decisions.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s016 (Action envelope inside the engine)

The server-facing protocol envelope is defined separately. The engine action should be pure data.

```ts
type Action =
  | { type: "playCard"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; costPayment?: PaymentSpec }
  | {
      type: "activateEffect";
      source: CardRef;
      effectId: string;
      costPayment?: PaymentSpec;
    }
  | { type: "attachDon"; donInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | {
      type: "respondToDecision";
      decisionId: string;
      response: DecisionResponse;
    };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s023 (Error handling inside the engine)

Engine errors are classified.

```ts
type EngineError =
  | { type: "illegalAction"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invalidDecisionResponse"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invariantViolation"; invariant: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "unsupportedCard"; cardId: CardId; status: CardSupportStatus }
  | { type: "effectRuntimeError"; effectId: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "loopDetected"; signature: LoopSignature };
```

Illegal player actions are rejected and logged. Invariant violations and effect runtime errors freeze or recover the match according to the recovery policy.

### 04-effect-runtime.s003 (Effect categories)

| Category    | Runtime behavior                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto        | Detected from `EngineEvent`s and queued.                   |
| Activate    | Exposed through legal actions during valid timing windows. |
| Permanent   | Contributes continuous modifiers to computed view.         |
| Replacement | Intercepts replaceable processes before atomic mutation.   |

### 04-effect-runtime.s008 (Trigger detection from events)

Trigger detection consumes event batches.

```ts
function detectTriggeredEffects(
  state: GameState,
  events: EngineEvent[],
): TriggerCandidate[] {
  const candidates: TriggerCandidate[] = [];

  for (const event of events) {
    candidates.push(...findAutoEffectsForEvent(state, event));
    candidates.push(...findReplacementFollowupsIfAny(state, event));
  }

  return candidates.filter((c) => canTriggerNow(c, state));
}
```

The engine must check source presence before queueing, then apply the queue entry's source-presence policy before resolution.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s003 (Top-level definition)

```ts
interface EffectDefinition {
  cardId: CardId;
  implementationStatus: CardSupportStatus;
  effects: EffectBlock[];
  metadata: EffectDefinitionMetadata;
}

interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  sourceTextHash: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  tested: boolean;
  reviewer?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s005 (Triggers)

```ts
type Trigger =
  | { type: "onPlay" }
  | { type: "whenAttacking" }
  | { type: "onOpponentAttack" }
  | { type: "onBlock" }
  | { type: "onKO" }
  | { type: "endOfYourTurn" }
  | { type: "endOfOpponentTurn" }
  | { type: "trigger" }
  | { type: "donAttach"; count: number }
  | { type: "activateMain" }
  | { type: "main" }
  | { type: "counter" }
  | { type: "permanent" }
  | { type: "replacement"; replacement: ReplacementTrigger }
  | { type: "startOfGame" }
  | { type: "startOfYourTurn" }
  | { type: "startOfOpponentTurn" }
  | { type: "startOfMainPhase" }
  | { type: "endOfBattle" }
  | { type: "custom"; event: string };
```

### 06-visibility-security.s007 (Legal-action visibility)

Legal actions can leak hidden information. The view should expose only what that recipient is entitled to know.

Examples:

- The defender should not see exactly why the server auto-passed the counter window.
- A player may see their own legal counter cards.
- The opponent sees only that the game progressed, not whether no counters existed or auto-pass was enabled.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 16-typescript-interface-draft.s011 (Poneglyph raw and normalized interfaces)

The first implementation should include these types in `@optcg/types` or `@optcg/cards` so the adapter, engine manifest, and tests agree on shape.

```ts
export type VariantKey = Brand<string, "VariantKey">; // generated, e.g. OP05-091:v2

export interface PoneglyphCardDetail {
  card_number: string;
  name: string;
  language: string;
  set: string;
  set_name: string;
  released_at: string | null;
  released: boolean;
  card_type: string;
  rarity: string | null;
  color: string[];
  cost: number | null;
  power: number | null;
  counter: number | null;
  life: number | null;
  attribute: string[] | null;
  types: string[];
  effect: string | null;
  trigger: string | null;
  block: string | null;
  variants: PoneglyphVariant[];
  legality: Record<string, PoneglyphLegalityRecord>;
  available_languages: string[];
  official_faq: PoneglyphOfficialFaq[];
}

export interface PoneglyphVariant {
  index: number;
  name: string | null;
  label: string | null;
  artist: string | null;
  product: {
    id: string | null;
    slug: string | null;
    name: string | null;
    set_code: string | null;
    released_at: string | null;
  };
  images: {
    stock: { full: string | null; thumb: string | null };
    scan: { display: string | null; full: string | null; thumb: string | null };
  };
  errata: PoneglyphErrata[];
  market: {
    tcgplayer_url: string | null;
    market_price: string | null;
    low_price: string | null;
    mid_price: string | null;
    high_price: string | null;
  };
}

export interface PoneglyphErrata {
  date: string;
  label: string | null;
  before_text: string | null;
  after_text: string | null;
  images?: {
    source?: string | null;
    scan?: {
      display: string | null;
      full: string | null;
      thumb: string | null;
    };
  };
}

export interface PoneglyphLegalityRecord {
  status: string;
  banned_at?: string;
  reason?: string;
  max_copies?: number;
  paired_with?: string[];
}

export interface PoneglyphOfficialFaq {
  question: string;
  answer: string;
  updated_on: string;
}

export interface ResolvedCardVariant {
  variantKey: VariantKey;
  variantIndex: number;
  label?: string;
  artist?: string;
  productId?: string;
  productSlug?: string;
  productName?: string;
  productSetCode?: string;
  stockImageFull?: string;
  stockImageThumb?: string;
  scanImageDisplay?: string;
  scanImageFull?: string;
  scanImageThumb?: string;
}

export interface ResolvedCard {
  cardId: CardId;
  language: string;
  name: string;
  category: CardCategory;
  set: string;
  setName: string;
  block?: string;
  released: boolean;
  releasedAt?: string;
  rarity?: string;
  colors: Color[];
  cost?: number;
  power?: number;
  counter?: number;
  life?: number;
  attributes: Attribute[];
  types: string[];
  effectText?: string;
  triggerText?: string;
  printedKeywords: Keyword[];
  variants: ResolvedCardVariant[];
  legality: Record<string, PoneglyphLegalityRecord>;
  officialFaq: PoneglyphOfficialFaq[];
  sourceTextHash: string;
  behaviorHash: string;
  support: CardImplementationRecord;
}
```

Replace the earlier `CardVariant.variantId` assumption with `variantKey` and `variantIndex`. The supplied Poneglyph examples expose variant indexes, including index `0`, not a distinct variant ID.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only Counter Event detection and fail-closed regression coverage around the Counter Step. Do not implement event cost payment, event effect resolution, target selection, or effect runtime behavior.

## Scope

- detect defender hand Event cards with raw `[Counter]` text or counter effect definitions as unsupported Counter Event candidates
- prevent no-counter auto-pass when unsupported Counter Event candidates are present
- ensure `useCounter` on an Event card fails closed without mutation until event-counter support exists
- preserve supported Character Counter behavior from ENG-019B when no unsupported Counter Event candidate is involved

## Out of Scope

- paying Event costs
- moving Counter Events to trash as successful use
- resolving Counter Event effects, target selection, replacement handling, or custom handlers
- Life Triggers, On K.O., opponent-attack effects, server/client/UI, database, or replay schema behavior

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/actions.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/actions.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions-test-fixtures.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/action-test-fixtures.ts

## Constraints

- create the ENG-019C substory branch from the ENG-019 parent integration branch after ENG-019B merges there
- generate and activate only the ENG-019C packet while implementing this story
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- do not implement Counter Event resolution in this story
- keep engine-core deterministic and pure
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- unit test proving raw `[Counter]` Event text prevents auto-pass and returns the deterministic unsupported Counter Event error without mutation
- unit test proving counter effect definition on an Event card prevents auto-pass and returns the deterministic unsupported Counter Event error without mutation
- unit test proving `useCounter` with an Event card fails closed without mutation
- regression test proving Character Counter use still succeeds when no unsupported Counter Event is present
- `corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/actions.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts` must pass
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck` must pass
- `corepack pnpm run verify` must pass

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- raw `[Counter]` Event text in defender hand causes the Counter Step path to fail closed rather than auto-pass
- counter-trigger effect definitions on defender Event cards cause the Counter Step path to fail closed rather than auto-pass
- `useCounter` with an Event card fails closed without mutation
- Character Counter behavior still works when unsupported Counter Events are absent
