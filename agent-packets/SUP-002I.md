## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 01-system-architecture.s023 (Poneglyph-centered card-data topology)

Poneglyph is external display/metadata truth. The simulator is gameplay truth.

```text
Poneglyph API
  -> @optcg/cards fetches and validates with Zod
  -> Redis read-through cache stores validated Poneglyph metadata
  -> certified parser rules may generate complete parsed effect definitions
  -> runtime capability matrix gates generated support status
  -> simulator overlay adds reviewed custom behavior, rulings, banlist status, and explicit overrides
  -> match server snapshots resolved cards at match creation
  -> engine consumes the match card manifest and effect registry
```

Important boundaries:

- The match server never trusts Poneglyph data supplied by the client.
- The client may fetch Poneglyph data for images/search/display only.
- The server validates every Poneglyph response before use.
- Simulator overlays are keyed by Poneglyph card ID.
- Common-template support is generated from complete parse plus runtime capability checks, not from a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map.
- Generated support records are fail-closed: any unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or capability-missing component keeps the card unsupported in normal play.
- Poneglyph variant indexes/generated variant keys are cosmetic and stored in deck data, not rule state.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseQuantity
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

For `chooseQuantity`, the response payload shape is `{ type: "chooseQuantity"; quantity: number }`. The outer `respondToDecision.decisionId` must name the active `chooseQuantity` decision. The inner `ChooseQuantityResponse` payload does not carry a decision ID; it is valid only when it has response type `chooseQuantity` and carries a whole integer `quantity` inside the decision's allowed `min` and `max` bounds.

Cardinality is explicit:

- exact-N decisions use `mode: "exact"` and must be represented with `min: N` and `max: N`; `mode: "exact"` with different `min` and `max` values is malformed and must not be created. A response below the required value, above it, non-integer, negative when the minimum is non-negative, or otherwise out-of-range is an `invalidDecisionResponse`.
- up-to-N decisions use `mode: "upTo"` and allow a partial response from `min` through `max`, inclusive. Choosing `max` is legal. Choosing less than `max` is legal only when it is still at least `min`.
- zero is legal only when the decision's `min` is `0`; exact-0 is represented as `min: 0`, `max: 0`, and `mode: "exact"`.
- minimum and maximum bounds are authoritative. Responses below `min`, above `max`, non-integer, missing, or with the wrong response type are rejected as `invalidDecisionResponse`.

Quantity decisions exposed through legal actions must advertise only public bounds, prompt text, and the active decision ID. They must not reveal hidden candidate counts, must not reveal hidden card identities, and must not encode whether a private candidate set contains a particular card. If a quantity is constrained by hidden information, the engine validates against the private candidate set internally and returns `invalidDecisionResponse` for illegal responses without disclosing the hidden reason through public legal actions or public events.

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

For optional costs, the only canonical decline route is the active
`PayCostDecision` answered with `PaymentDeclinedResponse`; optional cost decline
must not reuse `chooseOptionalActivation` and must not submit a partial
`PaymentResponse`. A stale optional-cost decision ID, malformed optional-cost
response, wrong player response, insufficient payment, response whose
`optionId` is not one of the active `paymentOptions`, or payment selection
outside the active decision context is rejected as `invalidDecisionResponse`.
These failures fail closed: they do not resolve the decision, do not record a
segment result, do not consume once-per-turn usage or other use counters, do not
emit public events describing hidden payment candidates, and must not reveal
hidden payment candidates, private DON!! choices, or internal failure details
through public legal actions, public events, PlayerView, or SpectatorView.
Optional cost payment uses `PayCostDecision`, not `chooseOptionalActivation`.
Optional cost decline uses `{ type: "paymentDeclined" }` and never carries
payment selections.
A rejected optional-cost response does not consume once-per-turn usage.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s003 (Top-level definition)

```ts
interface EffectDefinition {
  cardId: CardId;
  implementationStatus: CardSupportStatus;
  effects: EffectBlock[];
  metadata: EffectDefinitionMetadata;
}

interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  sourceTextHash: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  tested: boolean;
  reviewer?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s004 (Effect block)

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string;
  category: "auto" | "activate" | "permanent" | "replacement";
  trigger: Trigger;
  condition?: Condition;
  conditionTiming?: "activation" | "resolution" | "both";
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s006 (Conditions)

```ts
type Condition =
  | { type: "donCount"; target?: Target; min: number }
  | { type: "yourTurn" }
  | { type: "opponentTurn" }
  | { type: "lifeCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "fieldCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "handCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "trashCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "leaderColorCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "hasCardInZone"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter: CardFilter }
  | { type: "attackTarget"; targetType: "leader" | "character" | "any" }
  | { type: "cardState"; target: Target; state: "active" | "rested" }
  | { type: "sourceStillInZone" }
  | { type: "eventPayload"; path: string; op: Comparator; value: unknown }
  | { type: "and"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "or"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "not"; condition: Condition }
  | { type: "custom"; check: string };

type Comparator = "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte";
type PlayerRef =
  | "self"
  | "opponent"
  | "turnPlayer"
  | "nonTurnPlayer"
  | "owner"
  | "controller";
```

`leaderColorCount` is a public Leader metadata condition. It reads only the
player's Leader colors from the match manifest or resolved card snapshot, uses a
canonical `PlayerRef` and `Comparator`, and its `value` is a non-negative safe
integer. Printed "multicolored" Leader conditions map to
`{ type: "leaderColorCount", player: "self", op: "gte", value: 2 }`.

Leader type and Leader attribute conditions do not introduce `leaderType` or
`leaderAttribute` predicates. Represent them through the public Leader Area with
`hasCardInZone` and `CardFilter`, for example
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], typesAny: ["Straw Hat Crew"] } }`
or
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], attributesAny: ["slash"] } }`.
The schema-supported fixture subset admits only this public Leader-zone metadata
form and does not authorize private-zone metadata queries.

Condition, duration, and restriction primitives outside the schema-supported fixture subset remain planned layers. They are contract-defined by this reference, but they are not fixture-authorable until the schema coverage policy lists them as supported.

For public DON-on-field count authorability, use existing `fieldCount` with a
DON filter (`filter.categories` containing `"don"`), canonical comparator, and
non-negative threshold. In this DON filter form, schema fixtures support
`player: "self"` and `player: "opponent"` only, and reject free-text shortcuts.
This is contract/schema authorability evidence only and does not by itself imply
runtime executable support, parser certification, generated support, or card
playability.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s009 (Card filters)

```ts
interface CardFilter {
  cardIds?: CardId[];
  names?: string[];
  nameContains?: string;
  nameNot?: string[];
  categories?: CardCategory[];
  colorsAny?: Color[];
  colorsAll?: Color[];
  typesAny?: string[];
  typesAll?: string[];
  attributesAny?: Attribute[];
  attributesAll?: Attribute[];
  cost?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  power?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  counter?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  hasKeywords?: Keyword[];
  lacksKeywords?: Keyword[];
  state?: "active" | "rested" | "attached";
  owner?: PlayerRef;
  controller?: PlayerRef;
  excludeSelf?: boolean;
  custom?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s014 (Search request)

```ts
interface SearchRequest {
  zone: "deck" | "trash" | "life";
  player: PlayerRef;
  lookCount?: number;
  filter: CardFilter;
  min: number;
  max: number;
  destination: Zone;
  revealTo: Visibility;
  remainingCards?: {
    destination: Zone;
    position: "top" | "bottom";
    order: "ownerChoice" | "random";
  };
  shuffleAfter?: boolean;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s015 (Visibility)

```ts
type Visibility =
  | "bothPlayers"
  | "chooserOnly"
  | "ownerOnly"
  | "controllerOnly"
  | "hidden"
  | "replayOnly";
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s022 (Poneglyph text-to-DSL pipeline)

The effect-system plan supports three authoring paths:

1. Manual DSL definitions written by developers.
2. Custom TypeScript handlers for cards that cannot be expressed in DSL.
3. Generated DSL from Poneglyph printed card text when certified parser rules produce a complete parse and runtime capability checks pass.

Support ladder:

1. `contract-defined`: a primitive or behavior is described by the Markdown spec or canonical TypeScript contract.
2. `schema-authorable`: `contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` can validate JSON fixtures for that primitive.
3. `runtime-executable`: the current runtime capability matrix proves the engine can execute the primitive, including decisions, visibility, replay, failure policy, and pause/resume behavior.
4. `parser-certified`: reviewed parser rules produce a complete parse for the relevant printed text shape.
5. `generated-support playable`: a generated support record may enable normal play only when the parse is complete and every parsed component has current runtime capability evidence.

Schema authorability alone is insufficient for generated-support playable status. Generated support requires runtime capability evidence and complete parser support; schema validation only proves a JSON shape can be authored.

Generated definitions must never be deployed blindly. A new parser rule, ambiguous parse class, custom handler binding, or wording/ruling ambiguity requires review before it can certify support. Once a parser rule is certified, matching complete-parse cards may be generated without a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map for that common template.

A complete parse covers all gameplay-relevant printed text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement or optionality semantics, and ruling/errata inputs that affect behavior. Multiple parsed effects compose into one generated `EffectDefinition`. Partial parse output may be reported for coverage progress, but it must not make the card playable in normal modes.

Bandai or Poneglyph wording drift must invalidate the affected parse/hash evidence or downgrade support until parser and support evidence are updated. If any parsed component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing runtime capability evidence, the generated definition fails closed instead of partially enabling the card.

```ts
interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  source: "poneglyph";
  sourceTextHash: string;
  generatedBy?: "manual" | "rule-parser" | "llm-assisted";
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewedAt?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s029 (Schema coverage policy)

`contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` is the executable JSON fixture contract.
TypeScript/spec primitives outside that JSON schema are planned/not
fixture-authorable until schema validation and fixtures exist.
This list is the fixture-authorability boundary, not generated playable support.
Schema authorability alone does not imply runtime-executable,
parser-certified, or generated-support playable status. New TYP schema stories
may move primitives into the schema-supported fixture subset only when they also
add schema coverage and validation fixtures; generated playable support still
requires complete parser support and runtime capability evidence.

Schema-supported fixture subset:

- trigger: onPlay
- trigger: whenAttacking
- trigger: onOpponentAttack
- trigger: onBlock
- trigger: onKO
- trigger: endOfYourTurn
- trigger: endOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: trigger
- trigger: activateMain
- trigger: main
- trigger: counter
- trigger: permanent
- trigger: startOfGame
- trigger: startOfYourTurn
- trigger: startOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: startOfMainPhase
- trigger: endOfBattle
- trigger: donAttach
- trigger: custom
- condition: yourTurn
- condition: attachedDonCount
- condition: fieldCount
- condition: fieldCount DON filter authorability uses existing `fieldCount` +
  `CardFilter` (`categories` containing `don`) with `player` limited to `self`
  or `opponent`; this remains schema-authorability-only evidence and is not
  runtime/playability support
- condition: trashCount (public `player` + `op` + non-negative safe-integer `value`; optional public filter)
- cost: restDon
- cost: returnDon
- cost: restSelf
- cost: optional trashFromHand through `{ type: "payCost"; cost: OptionalCost }`
  sequence segments only; this is schema authorability for optional cost
  clauses, not non-optional activation `Cost.trashFromHand` authorability and
  not runtime/playability support
- cost: sequence
- target: self, myLeader, opponentLeader, attacker, attackTarget, blocker,
  triggerCard, all, choose, savedFieldObject
- duration: thisAction
- duration: thisBattle
- duration: thisTurn
- duration: untilEndOfTurn
- duration: untilStartOfNextTurn
- duration: whileSourceOnField
- duration: permanent
- effect: draw
- effect: drawUpTo
- effect: ko
- effect: modifyPower
- effect: setBasePower for scoped permanent continuous setters only:
  `target.type: "all"`, `target.zone: "characterArea"`,
  `target.player: "self"`, optional target `filter.typesAny`, numeric `value`,
  and `duration: { type: "permanent" }`; this is schema-authorability-only
  evidence and not runtime/playability support
- effect: search for scoped top-N deck requests only:
  `zone: "deck"`, `player: "self"`, positive integer `lookCount`,
  `destination: "hand"`, `min: 0`, `max: 1`,
  `remainingCards.destination: "deck"`, `remainingCards.position: "bottom"`,
  `remainingCards.order: "ownerChoice"`, and `shuffleAfter: false`. The
  schema-supported variants are public reveal to `bothPlayers` with a nonempty
  filter limited to `categories`, `colorsAny`, `typesAny`, and `nameNot`, or
  non-reveal any-card search to `chooserOnly` with an empty filter object. This
  is schema-authorability-only evidence and not runtime executable support,
  parser certification, generated support, support-report evidence, or card
  promotion.
- effect: payCost
- effect: selectCards
- effect: selectTargets
- effect: playSelected
- effect: sequence
- effect: cannotAttack
- effect: cannotBlock
- effect: giveKeyword
- effect: giveProtection (structured `Protection` metadata only; includes TYP-012A field-removal metadata shape)
- effect: custom
- card filters: cardIds, names, nameContains, nameNot, categories, colorsAny,
  colorsAll, typesAny, typesAll, attributesAny, attributesAll, cost, power,
  counter, hasKeywords, lacksKeywords, state, owner, controller, excludeSelf,
  custom

Planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage exists:

- condition: donCount
- condition: opponentTurn
- condition: lifeCount
- condition: handCount
- condition: hasCardInZone
- condition: attackTarget
- condition: cardState
- condition: sourceStillInZone
- condition: eventPayload
- condition: and, or, not, custom
- cost: trashFromHand as non-optional `Cost.trashFromHand`
- cost: trashSelf
- cost: trashFromField
- cost: discard
- cost: chooseOne
- cost: custom
- duration: whileConditionTrue
- effect: lookAtTop
- effect: revealFromZone
- effect: revealTop
- effect: selectFromSet
- effect: moveSelected with position
- effect: putRemaining
- effect: shuffleDeck
- effect: bounce
- effect: trash
- effect: play
- effect: returnUnselectedToDeck
- effect: trashFromHand
- effect: setPowerToZero
- effect: modifyCost
- effect: setBaseCost
- effect: rest
- effect: activate
- effect: removeKeyword
- effect: addDon
- effect: attachDon
- effect: returnDon
- effect: addLife
- effect: damage
- effect: invalidateEffects
- effect: protectFromKO
- effect: cannotBeAttacked
- effect: cannotBeBlockedBy
- effect: choice
- effect: conditional
- effect: forEachMatch
- effect: repeat
- effect: replacement

new fixture-authorable primitives must add schema coverage and validation fixtures in the same story that makes the primitive authorable.

### 11-testing-quality.s021 (v6 contract validation)

Add these checks to CI before broad card implementation:

```bash
tsc -p contracts/tsconfig.json
# validate each card effect fixture against contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json
# run a SQL parser/linter against contracts/database-schema-v6.sql
# validate approved story files against contracts/story.schema.json
```

The fixture validator must reject deprecated DSL aliases such as `costOp`, `costValue`, `typeIncludes`, `cardNameNot`, and `colorIncludes` in committed canonical definitions. A migration script may accept them only when converting legacy examples.

Every rules-timing algorithm tightened in the v4, v5, and v6 spec passes must have at least one named test in `18-acceptance-tests.md` when code behavior is affected.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Contract/schema/type story only. Do not implement runtime search behavior, ordering decisions, parser support, generated support, runtime capability metadata, support reports, real-card fixture evidence, or card promotion.

## Scope

- move scoped `search` schema coverage from planned/not fixture-authorable to fixture-authorable for positive Effect DSL fixtures
- prove a narrowed reusable SearchRequest shape with `zone: "deck"`, `player: "self"`, variable positive `lookCount`, `min: 0`, `max: 1`, hand destination, explicit `shuffleAfter: false` no-shuffle policy, and bottom remainder owner-choice policy
- support two scoped search authorability variants: public-reveal filtered search with `revealTo: "bothPlayers"` and composed `categories`/`colorsAny`/`typesAny`/`nameNot` filters; non-reveal any-card search with `revealTo: "chooserOnly"` and an empty filter object
- add negative fixtures for malformed look counts, unsupported zones, unsupported players, unsupported selection cardinality, out-of-scope CardFilter members, unsupported reveal visibility variants outside `bothPlayers` and `chooserOnly`, public-reveal empty-filter hybrids, chooser-only nonempty-filter hybrids, unsupported destinations, missing or true shuffle-after-search policy, and unsupported remainder policies
- preserve the distinction between contract authorability and runtime executable support

## Out of Scope

- engine runtime search behavior, ordering decisions, legal actions, or hidden-information filtering
- cards parser, generated support, runtime capability matrix, support reports, overlays, fixture capture, source hashes, behavior hashes, or card promotion
- search from trash/life, opponent search, top remainder placement, random remainder order, multi-card selection, search-and-play, trash remainder, nonempty arbitrary filters beyond the scoped fields, or public reveal inference from non-reveal text

## Allowed Touch Points

- fixtures/effect-dsl/**
- tests/contracts/**

## Constraints

- implement only SUP-002I while its packet is active
- do not touch engine or cards packages except type/schema test fallout required by contract tests
- fail closed if scoped top-N search cannot be made fixture-authorable without broadening unrelated Effect DSL shapes
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/types test`
- `corepack pnpm run contracts:validate-effects`
- `corepack pnpm run test:contracts`
- `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- contract/schema fixtures prove only the scoped top-N search request subset is authorable: `zone = deck`, `player = self`, `destination = hand`, `min = 0`, `max = 1`, `shuffleAfter = false`, `remainingCards.destination = deck`, `remainingCards.position = bottom`, and `remainingCards.order = ownerChoice`
- public-reveal filtered fixtures allow `revealTo = bothPlayers` only with a nonempty scoped filter using `categories`/`colorsAny`/`typesAny`/`nameNot` keys; `revealTo = bothPlayers` with an empty filter object is rejected
- non-reveal any-card fixtures allow `revealTo = chooserOnly` only with an empty filter object, so selected-card identity is not treated as public reveal
- specs and schema coverage no longer classify scoped top-N `search` as planned/not fixture-authorable for this story's shape
- no production code treats contract authorability as runtime support
