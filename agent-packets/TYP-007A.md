## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s009 (Pending decisions)

Effects, costs, target selection, optional activation, simultaneous trigger ordering, life triggers, and quantity choices all pause through the same model.

```ts
type PendingDecision =
  | ChooseTriggerOrderDecision
  | ChooseOptionalActivationDecision
  | PayCostDecision
  | SelectTargetsDecision
  | SelectCardsDecision
  | ChooseQuantityDecision
  | ChooseEffectOptionDecision
  | ConfirmLifeTriggerDecision
  | OrderCardsDecision
  | MulliganDecision
  | DeclareLoopCountDecision
  | RollbackConsentDecision;

interface BaseDecision {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  defaultResponse?: DecisionResponse;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
}

interface ChooseQuantityDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "chooseQuantity";
  min: number;
  max: number;
  mode: "exact" | "upTo";
  defaultResponse?: ChooseQuantityResponse;
}

interface ChooseQuantityResponse {
  type: "chooseQuantity";
  quantity: number;
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s015 (Legal actions)

`getLegalActions()` should return actions valid for the current game state and current pending decision.

```ts
function getLegalActions(state: GameState, playerId: PlayerId): LegalAction[] {
  if (state.pendingDecision) {
    return legalResponsesForDecision(state.pendingDecision, playerId, state);
  }

  return legalPhaseActions(state, playerId);
}
```

Legal actions sent to a client must not leak hidden information. For example, the opponent should not receive an action list that implies exactly which hidden counter cards exist.

Quantity decisions exposed through legal actions must advertise only public bounds, prompt text, and the active decision ID. They must not reveal hidden candidate counts, must not reveal hidden card identities, and must not encode whether a private candidate set contains a particular card. The authoritative engine may keep private candidate data server-side for validation, but public legal actions remain shaped as `respondToDecision` for the active decision.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s016 (Action envelope inside the engine)

The server-facing protocol envelope is defined separately. The engine action should be pure data.

```ts
type Action =
  | { type: "playCard"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; costPayment?: PaymentSpec }
  | {
      type: "activateEffect";
      source: CardRef;
      effectId: string;
      costPayment?: PaymentSpec;
    }
  | { type: "attachDon"; donInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | {
      type: "respondToDecision";
      decisionId: string;
      response: DecisionResponse;
    };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseQuantity
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

For `chooseQuantity`, the response payload shape is `{ type: "chooseQuantity"; quantity: number }`. The outer `respondToDecision.decisionId` must name the active `chooseQuantity` decision. The inner `ChooseQuantityResponse` payload does not carry a decision ID; it is valid only when it has response type `chooseQuantity` and carries a whole integer `quantity` inside the decision's allowed `min` and `max` bounds.

Cardinality is explicit:

- exact-N decisions use `mode: "exact"` and must be represented with `min: N` and `max: N`; `mode: "exact"` with different `min` and `max` values is malformed and must not be created. A response below the required value, above it, non-integer, negative when the minimum is non-negative, or otherwise out-of-range is an `invalidDecisionResponse`.
- up-to-N decisions use `mode: "upTo"` and allow a partial response from `min` through `max`, inclusive. Choosing `max` is legal. Choosing less than `max` is legal only when it is still at least `min`.
- zero is legal only when the decision's `min` is `0`; exact-0 is represented as `min: 0`, `max: 0`, and `mode: "exact"`.
- minimum and maximum bounds are authoritative. Responses below `min`, above `max`, non-integer, missing, or with the wrong response type are rejected as `invalidDecisionResponse`.

Quantity decisions exposed through legal actions must advertise only public bounds, prompt text, and the active decision ID. They must not reveal hidden candidate counts, must not reveal hidden card identities, and must not encode whether a private candidate set contains a particular card. If a quantity is constrained by hidden information, the engine validates against the private candidate set internally and returns `invalidDecisionResponse` for illegal responses without disclosing the hidden reason through public legal actions or public events.

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s008 (Targets)

Use `TargetRequest` when a player may choose and `Target` for source-relative automatic targets.

```ts
type Target =
  | { type: "self" }
  | { type: "myLeader" }
  | { type: "opponentLeader" }
  | { type: "attacker" }
  | { type: "attackTarget" }
  | { type: "blocker" }
  | { type: "triggerCard" }
  | { type: "all"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter?: CardFilter }
  | { type: "choose"; request: TargetRequest };

interface TargetRequest {
  timing: "onActivation" | "onResolution";
  chooser: PlayerRef;
  zone: Zone;
  player: PlayerRef;
  filter?: CardFilter;
  min: number;
  max: number;
  allowFewerIfUnavailable: boolean;
  visibility?: "public" | "privateToChooser";
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s012 (Effects)

```ts
type Effect =
  // Card movement
  | { type: "draw"; count: number; player: PlayerRef }
  | { type: "drawUpTo"; count: number; player: PlayerRef }
  | { type: "search"; request: SearchRequest }
  | { type: "lookAtTop"; player: PlayerRef; count: number }

    }
  | {
      type: "moveSelected";
      selection: SelectionId;

      to: Zone;
      position?: "top" | "bottom";
    }
  | {
      type: "putRemaining";
      zone: Zone;
      position: "top" | "bottom";
      order: "ownerChoice" | "chooserChoice" | "random";
    }

    }
  | {
      type: "trashFromHand";
      player: PlayerRef;
      count: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
    }

  // Power/cost modification
  | { type: "modifyPower"; target: Target; value: number; duration: Duration }
  | { type: "setPowerToZero"; target: Target; duration: Duration }
  | { type: "setBasePower"; target: Target; value: number; duration: Duration }
  | {
      type: "modifyCost";
      filter: CardFilter;
      value: number;
      duration: Duration;
      player: PlayerRef;
    }
  | { type: "setBaseCost"; target: Target; value: number; duration: Duration }

      duration: Duration;
    }
  | {
      type: "removeKeyword";
      target: Target;
      keyword: Keyword;
      duration: Duration;
    }

  // DON!!
  | { type: "addDon"; count: number; player: PlayerRef }
  | { type: "attachDon"; target: Target; count: number; player: PlayerRef }
  | { type: "returnDon"; count: number; player: PlayerRef }

  // Life and damage
  | {
      type: "addLife";
      count: number;
      player: PlayerRef;
      source: "deck" | "hand" | "trash";
      faceUp?: boolean;
    }
  | { type: "damage"; target: "leader"; player: PlayerRef; count: number }

  // Restrictions/protections
  | { type: "invalidateEffects"; target: Target; duration: Duration }
  | { type: "protectFromKO"; target: Target; duration: Duration }
  | { type: "cannotAttack"; target: Target; duration: Duration }
  | { type: "cannotBlock"; target: Target; duration: Duration }
  | { type: "cannotBeAttacked"; target: Target; duration: Duration }
  | {
      type: "cannotBeBlockedBy";
      target: Target;
      filter: CardFilter;
      duration: Duration;
    }

  // Composition
  | { type: "sequence"; effects: SequencedEffect[] }
  | {
      type: "choice";
      chooser: PlayerRef;
      options: EffectOption[];
      min: number;
      max: number;
    }
  | { type: "conditional"; if: Condition; then: Effect; else?: Effect }
  | {
      type: "forEachMatch";
      zone: Zone;
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter: CardFilter;
      effect: Effect;
    }
  | { type: "repeat"; count: number; effect: Effect }

  // Replacement/custom
  | { type: "replacement"; when: ReplacementTrigger; instead: Effect }
  | { type: "custom"; handler: string };
```

Cardinality fields such as `min` and `max` use the exact-N and up-to-N semantics from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`. `drawUpTo` is a planned `chooseQuantity`-backed primitive: it must pause through a `chooseQuantity` pending decision, validate the selected whole integer against public min/max bounds, and draw only the chosen amount when a future runtime story makes it executable.

Duration and restriction effects such as `cannotAttack`, `cannotBlock`, `cannotBeAttacked`, `cannotBeBlockedBy`, `invalidateEffects`, and `protectFromKO` remain planned unless the schema coverage policy lists them as schema-supported and the runtime capability matrix proves the active engine can enforce the restriction for the full duration.

### 11-testing-quality.s013 (Protocol tests)

Match-server tests:

- Duplicate `clientActionId` returns same result.
- Stale `expectedStateSeq` rejected.
- Wrong player action rejected.
- Decision response with wrong `decisionId` rejected.
- Reconnect returns current filtered view.
- Disconnect timer behavior.
- Ranked queue-created matches stamp `gameType`, `formatId`, and `ladderId` correctly.
- Custom lobby join rejects incorrect password and unauthorized spectator mode requests.
- Spectator cannot send actions.

### 22-v6-implementation-tightening.s006 (2. TypeScript model)

The old `16-typescript-interface-draft.md` was a draft and referenced undefined symbols. The implementation contract is now `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

Resolved and normalized items include:

- `Color` -> `CardColor`
- `Attribute`
- `ZoneRef`
- `MatchCardManifest`
- `RngState`
- `EffectQueueEntry`
- `ContinuousEffect`
- `EventVisibility`
- `CardRef`
- `DecisionResponse`
- `Cost`
- `PaymentOption`
- `TargetRequest`
- `CardSelectionRequest`
- `EffectOption`
- `PublicEffectEvent` replacement via filtered `EngineEvent[]`
- `PlayerView` and initial live-filtered `SpectatorView`
- public live-view DTO support contracts
- spectator-safe public-only reveal and event DTOs
- `eventLog`/`eventJournal` conflict resolved to `eventJournal`
- `activeBattle`/`battle` conflict resolved to `battle`
- serializable arrays instead of `Set`

The contract compiles with:

```bash
cd contracts
tsc -p tsconfig.json
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only canonical contracts, package type sync, and contract tests for cardinality and chooseQuantity DTOs, plus the narrow existing PlayerView projection adaptation needed to preserve the declared public pendingDecision shape. Do not implement runtime decision creation, response validation, parser certification, card support, or UI behavior.

## Scope

- define canonical exact-N and up-to-N cardinality contract shapes for reusable selection and quantity use
- enforce exact-N representation as `mode: "exact"`, `min: N`, and `max: N`; malformed exact ranges must reject
- define canonical chooseQuantity pending decision, response, action, and legal-action DTO shapes
- define public PlayerView pendingDecision exposure for chooseQuantity using only safe public fields such as decision identity, prompt text, min, max, and mode
- adapt the existing PlayerView pendingDecision projection so chooseQuantity bounds and mode are not erased if an active chooseQuantity decision is projected
- keep PlayerView legal actions for chooseQuantity decision-id-only unless an existing canonical public-action pattern requires otherwise
- add exported package type coverage synchronized from canonical contracts
- add contract/type tests for valid and invalid chooseQuantity/cardinality shapes

## Out of Scope

- engine decision creation, response validation, legal-action projection, stale-decision handling, or quantity runtime behavior beyond the narrow PlayerView projection shape adaptation
- card parser rules or generated-support certification
- replacement generalization
- server, client, API, UI, replay, database, or gameplay behavior

## Constraints

- keep canonical contracts as the source of truth
- do not use package-only type definitions as authority
- fail closed on public decision contract ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- focused contract/type tests for cardinality and chooseQuantity DTOs
- focused view/public pendingDecision and legal-action type tests for chooseQuantity exposure
- focused export ownership/cohesion tests if new package exports are added
- run `corepack pnpm run types:sync:check`
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/types test`
- run `corepack pnpm run test:contracts`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- canonical and package-exported types include exact-N and up-to-N cardinality support
- exact-N contracts reject `mode: "exact"` shapes where `min` and `max` differ
- canonical and package-exported types include chooseQuantity decision, action, response, and legal-action support
- public pendingDecision DTOs expose chooseQuantity bounds and mode without hidden candidate counts or hidden card identities
- public legal-action DTOs for chooseQuantity remain decision-id-only unless an existing canonical public-action pattern requires otherwise
- contract tests prove intended valid shapes compile/validate and malformed shapes fail
- no runtime or parser support is added

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
