# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: CARD-016A
Epic ID: CARD-016
Title: Current runtime component parser support
Type: implementation
Area: cards
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Add package-local reusable parser grammar/components so generated support can parse every currently runtime-capability-supported shape without growing by one-off exact text templates, while preserving fail-closed diagnostics for unsupported, incomplete, stale, or ambiguous text.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 01-system-architecture.s023 (Poneglyph-centered card-data topology)

Poneglyph is external display/metadata truth. The simulator is gameplay truth.

```text
Poneglyph API
  -> @optcg/cards fetches and validates with Zod
  -> Redis read-through cache stores validated Poneglyph metadata
  -> certified parser rules may generate complete parsed effect definitions
  -> runtime capability matrix gates generated support status
  -> simulator overlay adds reviewed custom behavior, rulings, banlist status, and explicit overrides
  -> match server snapshots resolved cards at match creation
  -> engine consumes the match card manifest and effect registry
```

Important boundaries:

- The match server never trusts Poneglyph data supplied by the client.
- The client may fetch Poneglyph data for images/search/display only.
- The server validates every Poneglyph response before use.
- Simulator overlays are keyed by Poneglyph card ID.
- Common-template support is generated from complete parse plus runtime capability checks, not from a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map.
- Generated support records are fail-closed: any unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or capability-missing component keeps the card unsupported in normal play.
- Poneglyph variant indexes/generated variant keys are cosmetic and stored in deck data, not rule state.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s003 (Top-level definition)

```ts
interface EffectDefinition {
  cardId: CardId;
  implementationStatus: CardSupportStatus;
  effects: EffectBlock[];
  metadata: EffectDefinitionMetadata;
}

interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  sourceTextHash: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  tested: boolean;
  reviewer?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s013 (Sequence connector semantics)

`Effect.type = "sequence"` uses explicit segment connectors. This avoids ambiguity in card text such as "Then", "If you do", and "If possible".

```ts
interface SequencedEffect {
  id?: string;
  effect: Effect;
  connector:
    | "always"
    | "then"
    | "ifPreviousSucceeded"
    | "ifYouDo"
    | "ifPossible";
  saveResultAs?: string;
}
```

Connector behavior:

| Connector             | Runtime behavior                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `always`              | Run this segment regardless of the previous segment result.                                                                          |
| `then`                | Run after the previous segment; if the previous segment was impossible, continue only when card text says to do as much as possible. |
| `ifPreviousSucceeded` | Run only if the previous segment changed game state or made a legal selection.                                                       |
| `ifYouDo`             | Run only if the player chose/performed the previous optional instruction.                                                            |
| `ifPossible`          | Attempt the segment if there is a legal way to perform it; no error if there is not.                                                 |

A segment result must record at least:

```text
attempted
succeeded
changedState
selectedCards
selectedTargets
paidCost
playerDeclined
```

Those fields drive later connector decisions and replay determinism. Runtime frame, pause/resume, saved-reference, and failure-policy behavior for composed execution is authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s010`, `04-effect-runtime.s012`, and `04-effect-runtime.s016`.

Saved references include `saveResultAs`, `SelectionSetId`, and `SelectionId`. A saved reference is contract-defined here, but generated support may rely on it only when schema validation, parser certification, and runtime capability evidence all cover the reference lifetime, visibility, and later-use legality.

A saved field-object reference is a same-frame saved-reference family for later text such as "that Character". The supported field-object families are `selectedTargets` and `producedObjects`; `selectedCards`, `paidCost`, `SelectionSetId`, `SelectionId`, and saved hand-selection references are separate families and are not field-object target references. A segment with `saveResultAs` may expose `selectedTargets` when it legally selected field objects through a target request, and may expose `producedObjects` when a supported runtime story later creates or moves a public field object and records that object as produced by the segment.

A later segment consumes a saved field-object reference with `{ type: "savedFieldObject", binding: { family: "selectedTargets" | "producedObjects", saveResultAs, objectIndex?, sourceSegmentId? }, zone, player, controller?, filter?, visibility: "publicOnly", onFailure: "failClosed" }`. The reference is valid only inside the same effect execution frame, only for the named `saveResultAs` ledger entry, and only while the referenced object remains a public legal object for the later instruction. unsupported saved-reference families fail closed. stale objects, gone objects, hidden objects, and illegal objects fail closed. Public events, public legal actions, PlayerView, and SpectatorView must not reveal hidden identities or the private saved-reference failure reason. State hashes include the frame saved-reference ledger and the failed segment result so replay, event order, and connector decisions remain deterministic.

Optionality must preserve optional activation, optional cost, and optional effect clause distinctions. These boundaries are part of generated-support capability evidence because a parser that recognizes optional text still cannot make the effect playable unless the runtime can resume and record the correct optional segment result.

Optional cost clauses inside composed sequence execution use a sequence segment
whose effect is `{ type: "payCost"; cost: OptionalCost }`. The optionality flag
lives on the nested `OptionalCost`; `SequencedEffect.optional` remains reserved
for optional effect clauses and must not be used to represent optional cost
decline. Runtime decline for that segment uses the `PayCostDecision` and
`PaymentDeclinedResponse` contract from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s012`
and `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`.
Optional cost decline uses the active `PayCostDecision` and a
`PaymentDeclinedResponse` payload.

`ifYouDo` after an optional cost runs only when the previous cost segment
recorded `paidCost: true`. A declined or failed optional cost segment does not
run dependent `ifYouDo` segments. Segment-result, event-order, state-hash, and
once-per-turn timing for optional cost accept, decline, and failure are
authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s011` and `04-effect-runtime.s012`.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s014 (Search request)

```ts
interface SearchRequest {
  zone: "deck" | "trash" | "life";
  player: PlayerRef;
  lookCount?: number;
  filter: CardFilter;
  min: number;
  max: number;
  destination: Zone;
  revealTo: Visibility;
  remainingCards?: {
    destination: Zone;
    position: "top" | "bottom";
    order: "ownerChoice" | "random";
  };
  shuffleAfter?: boolean;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  generatedSupportId?: string;
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted. For common templates, implementation may come from a generated support index entry instead of a manual per-card overlay when the complete parse, parser certification, and runtime capability checks all pass.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s012 (Deck validation)

Deck validation resolves and validates against Poneglyph IDs, Poneglyph legality records, and simulator support metadata. Poneglyph is the canonical external source for format/card legality inputs such as legal status, bans, and copy limits; the simulator may only layer unsupported-card policy or platform-specific constraints on top.

Generated support index output is simulator support metadata. Deck validation may treat a generated record as `implemented-dsl` or `implemented-custom` only when the record has complete parse evidence, current source/behavior hashes, certified parser-rule evidence, and a runtime capability matrix result proving every component is supported.

```ts
interface DeckValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: DeckValidationError[];
  warnings: DeckValidationWarning[];
  resolvedCards: ResolvedDeckCard[];
  versions: {
    cardDataVersion: string;
    effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
    overlayVersion: string;
    banlistVersion: string;
  };
}
```

Validation checks:

- Leader count and leader identity.
- Main deck size.
- DON!! deck size.
- Leader/color restrictions.
- Per-card copy limits by Poneglyph base `cardId`.
- Official format restrictions.
- Simulator-specific bans.
- Unsupported-card status.
- Variant IDs resolve to valid Poneglyph variants for the base card.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s014 (Canonical Poneglyph normalization)

The Poneglyph adapter emits `ResolvedCard` from `contracts/canonical-types.ts`. Important normalization rules:

- `attribute` values become `attributes: Attribute[]`; never collapse to a singular attribute.
- `color` values become `colors: CardColor[]`; multi-color cards preserve all colors.
- `variants[].index` becomes `variantIndex`.
- `variantKey = `${cardId}:v${variantIndex}``.
- Missing market prices, product set codes, or image URLs are allowed display gaps and must not fail gameplay resolution.
- Search endpoint DTOs are never accepted as manifest card details. Only detail/batch card payloads can become `ResolvedCard`.
- `sourceTextHash` covers printed effect/trigger text used for implementation drift.
- `behaviorHash` covers stats, type line, effect, trigger, official FAQ, errata, and any source field that can alter behavior.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s015 (Poneglyph text hash and stale-card review)

Every supported card stores a hash of its Poneglyph printed text and, when generated support is used, a behavior hash or parser-evidence hash for the complete parsed behavior.

When the Poneglyph text changes:

1. Mark the card implementation as stale.
2. Fail CI if a stale card remains marked `tested` without review.
3. Prevent ranked use if the changed text affects card behavior.
4. Require parser/support evidence to be updated before generated support may remain playable.
5. Require a reviewer to update the source hash after verifying any DSL/custom handler or certified parser-rule evidence that remains authoritative.

This catches errata, typo fixes that affect parsing, and Poneglyph schema/text changes.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s022 (Security checklist)

- Server never trusts card metadata from client.
- Poneglyph response is schema-validated before cache write.
- Overlay merge is versioned.
- Match snapshots resolved cards before play starts.
- Unsupported cards are rejected in public modes.
- Variant IDs are cosmetic and never affect rules.
- Poneglyph text hash changes trigger implementation review.
- Replays store versions and manifest hashes.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s024 (Source hash and behavior hash)

Use both hashes:

```ts
interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId;
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // effect + trigger text only
  behaviorHash: string; // stats + type line + effect + trigger + FAQ + errata
  notes?: string;
}
```

`OP01-060` demonstrates why `behaviorHash` matters: the FAQ clarifies that an unplayed revealed card returns to the top of the deck face-down. A change to that FAQ would affect hidden-information behavior even if the printed effect text did not change.

### 11-testing-quality.s020 (Poneglyph/card-data tests)

Add card-data tests once `@optcg/cards` exists:

```text
CD-001 Poneglyph response validates against Zod schema
CD-002 invalid Poneglyph shape fails before Redis cache write
CD-003 Redis cache key includes cardDataVersion and overlay/effect version
CD-004 overlay merge adds support status and effect definition IDs
CD-005 Poneglyph source text hash drift marks implementation stale
CD-006 unsupported non-vanilla Poneglyph card cannot enter ranked deck
CD-007 variant indexes/generated variant keys are accepted only when valid for the base card
CD-008 client display data cannot alter server-resolved match manifest
CD-009 generated support index accepts only complete-parse cards whose every parsed component is covered by the runtime capability matrix
CD-010 partial, ambiguous, stale, unparsed, unsupported, or capability-missing generated support reports do not make cards playable in normal modes
CD-011 certified parser-rule fixtures auto-support matching complete-parse common-template cards without a manual per-card allowlist
```

These tests prevent the card-data layer from becoming an implicit rules authority.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only cards-side parser grammar/components, generated-support parse construction over existing effect DSL schema and runtime capability evidence, parser trace diagnostics for failures, support probe/report propagation, and tests. This story must not add runtime behavior, runtime capability records, shared schema authority, fixture evidence, or card-specific one-off exact text templates. Generated support may become playable only for complete parses that pass existing schema, source integrity, metadata, review/test, and runtime capability gates.

## Scope

- inventory the current `generatedSupportRuntimeCapabilityMatrix` and current generated-support parser rules before implementation
- replace exact-template parser growth with reusable package-local grammar/components for trigger wrappers, once-per-turn wrappers, conditions, connectors, cardinality, quantity comparators, public field targets, hand selections, costs, actions, destinations, durations, modifiers, restrictions, saved references, and sequence segments
- produce complete generated-support parses for every currently runtime-capability-supported generated-support shape whose text can be represented by existing effect DSL schema and existing runtime capability evidence
- preserve fail-closed support for any currently supported runtime capability that still lacks safe card-layer parser/schema/source/metadata authority, and record a concrete blocker naming the missing authority
- emit parser trace diagnostics from the same reusable components when a complete parse cannot be produced
- support existing generated-support shapes without relying on one-off exact text templates as the scaling mechanism, including draw, drawUpTo, draw/trash sequences, trash/draw sequences, optional supported draw effects, supported conditions, returnDon plus hand selection plus playSelected, selectTargets plus saved field object KO, self/all supported modifyPower/cannotAttack/cannotBlock shapes, supported keywords, supported source-presence policy combinations, supported costs, supported durations, and supported sequence frames where existing capability evidence is truthful
- handle `up to N` as cardinality/choice grammar, not as a bespoke phrase per effect
- handle quantity-comparator phrases such as `N power or less`, `N power or more`, and `N cost or less` as predicate/comparator grammar, not as boolean `or` connectors
- handle boolean connectors only where unambiguous and where all connected predicate grammar and runtime/schema support exists; ambiguous `or` remains fail-closed with trace output
- keep hand-selection grammar separate from public field target grammar
- preserve existing CARD-015A conditional draw diagnostics but derive them from reusable trace components where practical
- for `[On Play] Place up to 1 of your opponent's Characters with 1000 power or less at the bottom of the owner's deck.`, report reusable trace components for `[On Play]`, `up to 1`, `your opponent's Characters`, `1000 power or less`, and the bottom-deck action/destination; make it playable only if existing schema and runtime capability evidence truthfully support that complete move-to-bottom-deck shape, otherwise keep it unsupported with the exact missing authority
- keep EB02-027 and EB02-026 text examples as support/diagnostic probes only unless all generated-support gates pass from existing source/schema/runtime metadata
- preserve blocker identity for existing codes `unparsed-span`, `ambiguous-wording`, `custom-handler-required`, `unsupported-primitive`, `stale-hash`, `invalid-dsl-schema`, and `missing-runtime-capability`
- keep stale hash as the highest-priority diagnostic and do not silently refresh or rewrite fixture evidence
- allow whole-card unsupported diagnostics only when no reusable trace component can safely identify a narrower component

## Out of Scope

- new runtime behavior or runtime capability records
- real-card fixture support, fixture capture, fixture recapture, or hash updates
- shared contracts or effect DSL schema changes
- server, client, API, UI, database, replay, WebSocket, Redis, or live Poneglyph work
- replacement generalization
- card-specific one-off exact text templates as the scaling strategy

## Constraints

- generate and activate the CARD-016A packet before implementation
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- do not add runtime behavior, runtime capability records, fixture support, shared schema authority, or card-specific one-off exact text templates
- keep diagnostic helper types package-local to packages/cards unless story-review proves a real shared authority gap
- fail closed when trace components cannot determine a trusted narrower component, connector, comparator, target, action, or source span
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- exact candidate story-review before approval handoff
- runtime capability inventory test proving every supported capability matrix record is either covered by reusable parser grammar or recorded with an explicit blocker category
- parser component unit tests for trigger wrapper, once-per-turn wrapper, `if` wrapper, exact integer cardinality, `up to N`, `N power or less`, `N power or more`, public field targets, hand selections, costs, actions, destinations, durations, modifiers, restrictions, saved references, sequence segments, and ambiguous `or`
- generated-support tests proving existing supported draw, drawUpTo, draw/trash, trash/draw, optional draw, condition, returnDon/hand-selection/playSelected, selectTargets/saved-KO, modifier, restriction, keyword, source-presence, and sequence-frame shapes remain supported through reusable parser components where existing capability evidence is truthful
- support-probe test proving EB02-027-style text reports `[On Play]`, `up to 1`, `your opponent's Characters`, `1000 power or less`, and bottom-deck action/destination candidate fragments when unsupported, or proves complete generated support if every existing gate passes
- generated-support report test proving EB02-027-style text exposes the same trace fragments or generated-support evidence as structured metadata
- support-probe/report tests proving `or less` is not reported as a boolean conjunction
- regression tests proving EB02-026-style conditional draw diagnostics from CARD-015A remain present when unsupported, or proving complete generated support if every existing gate passes
- missing runtime capability, invalid schema, and stale-hash diagnostics remain unchanged when those deeper layers already apply
- existing support-probe and generated-support report snapshots or assertions remain compatible
- regression tests proving existing CARD-008, CARD-009, CARD-012, CARD-013, CARD-014, and CARD-015 generated-support behavior remains supported or unsupported exactly as before
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/cards test`
- full `corepack pnpm verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- generated-support parser coverage is component-driven rather than one-off exact text template driven
- every currently runtime-capability-supported generated-support shape is either covered by reusable parser components or recorded as a concrete blocker with the missing parser/schema/runtime/source/metadata authority named
- support-probe and generated-support report diagnostics are more actionable for parser failures because they use the same reusable components as the parser
- unsupported text remains unsupported whenever complete parse, schema, source integrity, metadata, or existing runtime capability evidence is missing
- existing CARD-008, CARD-009, CARD-012, CARD-013, CARD-014, and CARD-015 generated-support behavior remains compatible
- reusable parser components, not one-off card-specific decomposers, produce the parser-failure breakdowns
- trace output distinguishes recognized candidates from certified complete generated support
- comparator phrases `or less` and `or more` remain part of predicate/cardinality diagnostics and are not misreported as boolean `or` connectors
- the text `[On Play] Place up to 1 of your opponent's Characters with 1000 power or less at the bottom of the owner's deck.` either becomes generated-supported through complete reusable parser/schema/runtime/source/metadata evidence or remains unsupported with exact missing authority and trigger, cardinality, target, predicate/comparator, and action/destination trace fragments
- the text `[On Play] If your Leader is multicolored and you have 5 or less cards in your hand, draw 2 cards.` either becomes generated-supported through complete reusable parser/schema/runtime/source/metadata evidence or remains unsupported with the CARD-015A conditional draw fragments through the reusable trace path
- whole-card unsupported diagnostics are used only when no reusable trace component safely matched
- stale hash remains highest-priority and does not mutate fixture evidence

## Post-Approval Role Sections

### implementation

Responsibilities
- implement only the approved story using packet authority order
- follow strict TypeScript, lint, and verification requirements
- report ambiguity instead of inventing uncited behavior

Forbidden Actions
- do not broaden scope beyond the approved story boundary or allowed_touch_points
- do not add packet extraction behavior unless the approved story explicitly owns it
- do not implement story-author/story-review handoff mechanics

Required Inputs
- active packet content with authoritative spec references
- approved story scope, non-scope, and acceptance criteria
- allowed_touch_points and required test list

Required Outputs
- scoped code and test changes within approved touch points
- verification command results with pass/fail status
- assumptions and blockers note

Verification Checklist
- confirm required inputs are present and current
- confirm forbidden actions are not introduced
- confirm required outputs are produced for handoff

### code-review

Responsibilities
- review correctness, scope fit, and required-test coverage
- verify no forbidden role sections or lifecycle changes were introduced
- confirm canonical packet behavior remains enforceable

Forbidden Actions
- do not author new feature scope outside the reviewed patch
- do not bypass required tests, packet verification, or CI gate evidence
- do not approve scope drift that violates story boundary

Required Inputs
- proposed patch limited to approved touch points
- active packet, approved story, and cited spec references
- verification and test evidence for required commands

Required Outputs
- review findings prioritized by correctness and scope compliance
- clear disposition for findings (fix/defer/block) with rationale
- review closure recommendation for Session Orchestrator handoff

Verification Checklist
- confirm required inputs are present and current
- confirm forbidden actions are not introduced
- confirm required outputs are produced for handoff

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
```
