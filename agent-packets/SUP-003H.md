## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 01-system-architecture.s023 (Poneglyph-centered card-data topology)

Poneglyph is external display/metadata truth. The simulator is gameplay truth.

```text
Poneglyph API
  -> @optcg/cards fetches and validates with Zod
  -> Redis read-through cache stores validated Poneglyph metadata
  -> certified parser rules may generate complete parsed effect definitions
  -> runtime capability matrix gates generated support status
  -> simulator overlay adds reviewed custom behavior, rulings, banlist status, and explicit overrides
  -> match server snapshots resolved cards at match creation
  -> engine consumes the match card manifest and effect registry
```

Important boundaries:

- The match server never trusts Poneglyph data supplied by the client.
- The client may fetch Poneglyph data for images/search/display only.
- The server validates every Poneglyph response before use.
- Simulator overlays are keyed by Poneglyph card ID.
- Common-template support is generated from complete parse plus runtime capability checks, not from a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map.
- Generated support records are fail-closed: any unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or capability-missing component keeps the card unsupported in normal play.
- Poneglyph variant indexes/generated variant keys are cosmetic and stored in deck data, not rule state.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s008 (Setup sequence)

Use a deterministic setup flow:

```text
1. Validate decks, card support, format, banlist.
2. Determine first/second player.
3. Build initial full GameState.
4. Resolve start-of-game effects that modify setup.
5. Shuffle decks using recorded RNG.
6. Draw opening hands.
7. Handle official mulligan decisions: each player may once either keep or return all 5 to deck, reshuffle, and redraw 5, in first-player-then-second-player order.
8. Place Life from the top of deck equal to Leader life using the canonical orientation algorithm below.
9. Start first player's Refresh Phase.
```

Start-of-game effects that alter decks must happen before final shuffle and opening draw.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s044 (Confirmed rulings carried forward)

- Effect resolution uses a queue model.
- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are waiting, and resolving A triggers turn player effect C, B resolves before C.
- Simultaneous effects controlled by the same player are ordered by that player.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage processing finishes.
- Effects triggered by card/effect activation resolve after the triggering effect finishes.
- Start-of-game effects can modify the deck before opening draw.

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

### 04-effect-runtime.s007 (Source presence policy)

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s003 (Top-level definition)

```ts
interface EffectDefinition {
  cardId: CardId;
  implementationStatus: CardSupportStatus;
  effects: EffectBlock[];
  metadata: EffectDefinitionMetadata;
}

interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  sourceTextHash: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  tested: boolean;
  reviewer?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s004 (Effect block)

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string;
  category: "auto" | "activate" | "permanent" | "replacement";
  trigger: Trigger;
  condition?: Condition;
  conditionTiming?: "activation" | "resolution" | "both";
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s005 (Triggers)

```ts
type Trigger =
  | { type: "onPlay" }
  | { type: "whenAttacking" }
  | { type: "onOpponentAttack" }
  | { type: "onBlock" }
  | { type: "onKO" }
  | { type: "endOfYourTurn" }
  | { type: "endOfOpponentTurn" }
  | { type: "trigger" }
  | { type: "donAttach"; count: number }
  | { type: "activateMain" }
  | { type: "main" }
  | { type: "counter" }
  | { type: "permanent" }
  | { type: "replacement"; replacement: ReplacementTrigger }
  | { type: "startOfGame" }
  | { type: "startOfYourTurn" }
  | { type: "startOfOpponentTurn" }
  | { type: "startOfMainPhase" }
  | { type: "endOfBattle" }
  | { type: "custom"; event: string };
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s006 (Conditions)

```ts
type Condition =
  | { type: "donCount"; target?: Target; min: number }
  | { type: "yourTurn" }
  | { type: "opponentTurn" }
  | { type: "lifeCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "fieldCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "handCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "trashCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "leaderColorCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "hasCardInZone"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter: CardFilter }
  | { type: "attackTarget"; targetType: "leader" | "character" | "any" }
  | { type: "cardState"; target: Target; state: "active" | "rested" }
  | { type: "sourceStillInZone" }
  | { type: "eventPayload"; path: string; op: Comparator; value: unknown }
  | { type: "and"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "or"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "not"; condition: Condition }
  | { type: "custom"; check: string };

type Comparator = "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte";
type PlayerRef =
  | "self"
  | "opponent"
  | "turnPlayer"
  | "nonTurnPlayer"
  | "owner"
  | "controller";
```

`leaderColorCount` is a public Leader metadata condition. It reads only the
player's Leader colors from the match manifest or resolved card snapshot, uses a
canonical `PlayerRef` and `Comparator`, and its `value` is a non-negative safe
integer. Printed "multicolored" Leader conditions map to
`{ type: "leaderColorCount", player: "self", op: "gte", value: 2 }`.

Leader type and Leader attribute conditions do not introduce `leaderType` or
`leaderAttribute` predicates. Represent them through the public Leader Area with
`hasCardInZone` and `CardFilter`, for example
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], typesAny: ["Straw Hat Crew"] } }`
or
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], attributesAny: ["slash"] } }`.
The schema-supported fixture subset admits only this public Leader-zone metadata
form and does not authorize private-zone metadata queries.

Condition, duration, and restriction primitives outside the schema-supported fixture subset remain planned layers. They are contract-defined by this reference, but they are not fixture-authorable until the schema coverage policy lists them as supported.

For public DON-on-field count authorability, use existing `fieldCount` with a
DON filter (`filter.categories` containing `"don"`), canonical comparator, and
non-negative threshold. In this DON filter form, schema fixtures support
`player: "self"` and `player: "opponent"` only, and reject free-text shortcuts.
This is contract/schema authorability evidence only and does not by itself imply
runtime executable support, parser certification, generated support, or card
playability.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  generatedSupportId?: string;
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted. For common templates, implementation may come from a generated support index entry instead of a manual per-card overlay when the complete parse, parser certification, and runtime capability checks all pass.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s012 (Deck validation)

Deck validation resolves and validates against Poneglyph IDs, Poneglyph legality records, and simulator support metadata. Poneglyph is the canonical external source for format/card legality inputs such as legal status, bans, and copy limits; the simulator may only layer unsupported-card policy or platform-specific constraints on top.

Generated support index output is simulator support metadata. Deck validation may treat a generated record as `implemented-dsl` or `implemented-custom` only when the record has complete parse evidence, current source/behavior hashes, certified parser-rule evidence, and a runtime capability matrix result proving every component is supported.

```ts
interface DeckValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: DeckValidationError[];
  warnings: DeckValidationWarning[];
  resolvedCards: ResolvedDeckCard[];
  versions: {
    cardDataVersion: string;
    effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
    overlayVersion: string;
    banlistVersion: string;
  };
}
```

Validation checks:

- Leader count and leader identity.
- Main deck size.
- DON!! deck size.
- Leader/color restrictions.
- Per-card copy limits by Poneglyph base `cardId`.
- Official format restrictions.
- Simulator-specific bans.
- Unsupported-card status.
- Variant IDs resolve to valid Poneglyph variants for the base card.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s014 (Canonical Poneglyph normalization)

The Poneglyph adapter emits `ResolvedCard` from `contracts/canonical-types.ts`. Important normalization rules:

- `attribute` values become `attributes: Attribute[]`; never collapse to a singular attribute.
- `color` values become `colors: CardColor[]`; multi-color cards preserve all colors.
- `variants[].index` becomes `variantIndex`.
- `variantKey = `${cardId}:v${variantIndex}``.
- Missing market prices, product set codes, or image URLs are allowed display gaps and must not fail gameplay resolution.
- Search endpoint DTOs are never accepted as manifest card details. Only detail/batch card payloads can become `ResolvedCard`.
- `sourceTextHash` covers printed effect/trigger text used for implementation drift.
- `behaviorHash` covers stats, type line, effect, trigger, official FAQ, errata, and any source field that can alter behavior.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s018 (Effect coverage report)

Generate this in CI from Poneglyph total cards plus simulator overlay status.

```text
Total cards in Poneglyph:      2347
Vanilla confirmed:              420
DSL implemented:               1530
Custom implemented:              73
Unsupported:                    324
Banned in simulator:              0
Implemented cards tested:      1603 / 1603
Cards with stale text hash:       12
```

Primitive usage report:

```text
draw:              321
ko:                118
search:             94
modifyPower:       402
replacement:        27
custom handler:     73
```

High repeated custom-handler usage suggests the DSL is missing primitives.

Effect coverage and primitive usage reports are progress evidence only. They must not promote partial, stale, ambiguous, unparsed, unsupported, or capability-missing generated support into playable normal-mode support.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s024 (Source hash and behavior hash)

Use both hashes:

```ts
interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId;
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // effect + trigger text only
  behaviorHash: string; // stats + type line + effect + trigger + FAQ + errata
  notes?: string;
}
```

`OP01-060` demonstrates why `behaviorHash` matters: the FAQ clarifies that an unplayed revealed card returns to the top of the deck face-down. A change to that FAQ would affect hidden-information behavior even if the printed effect text did not change.

### 11-testing-quality.s020 (Poneglyph/card-data tests)

Add card-data tests once `@optcg/cards` exists:

```text
CD-001 Poneglyph response validates against Zod schema
CD-002 invalid Poneglyph shape fails before Redis cache write
CD-003 Redis cache key includes cardDataVersion and overlay/effect version
CD-004 overlay merge adds support status and effect definition IDs
CD-005 Poneglyph source text hash drift marks implementation stale
CD-006 unsupported non-vanilla Poneglyph card cannot enter ranked deck
CD-007 variant indexes/generated variant keys are accepted only when valid for the base card
CD-008 client display data cannot alter server-resolved match manifest
CD-009 generated support index accepts only complete-parse cards whose every parsed component is covered by the runtime capability matrix
CD-010 partial, ambiguous, stale, unparsed, unsupported, or capability-missing generated support reports do not make cards playable in normal modes
CD-011 certified parser-rule fixtures auto-support matching complete-parse common-template cards without a manual per-card allowlist
```

These tests prevent the card-data layer from becoming an implicit rules authority.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Cards-layer composition and proof story only. SUP-003E, SUP-003F, and SUP-003G must already be implemented. Do not add new engine runtime behavior, shared contract/schema changes, deck validation enforcement, real-card fixture promotion, source hashes, behavior hashes, overlays, or card-specific branches.

## Scope

- compose the certified non-runtime deck-rule primitive from SUP-003E with the start-of-game Stage play primitive from SUP-003G when both appear in one sentence joined by `and`
- compose the first-sentence support with a separate Activate Main line from SUP-003F through the existing complete-parse/generated-support proof path
- prove full representative leader text can pass parse completeness through reusable primitives while preserving separate runtime and non-runtime evidence for each clause
- vary deck-rule threshold, Stage type, Activate Main field-trash type, and draw count in composition tests to prevent exact full-card matching
- preserve fail-closed behavior when one clause is unsupported, partially parsed, missing certification, or missing runtime capability evidence

## Out of Scope

- engine runtime behavior or shared contract/schema changes
- deck validation enforcement
- real-card fixture capture, source hash updates, behavior hash updates, overlays, supported-card manifests, or cards-produced manifests
- exact card IDs, exact full-card text, external card lists, or one-off full-effect branches
- new parser primitives beyond composing SUP-003E, SUP-003F, and SUP-003G outputs

## Constraints

- implement only SUP-003H while its packet is active
- do not activate or implement SUP-003H until SUP-003E, SUP-003F, and SUP-003G have landed as reviewed prerequisite evidence on the active parent integration branch
- stop and split if full composition requires new engine runtime behavior, shared contract/schema work, or new parser primitives beyond explicit composition gaps
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- full representative multiline support-evaluator regression for deck rule plus start-of-game Stage play plus Activate Main optional choose-one cost draw
- real-schema generated-support regression validating every produced Effect DSL block for the composed multiline representative row and its parameterized composition matrix
- composition test varying deck-rule threshold, Stage type, field-trash type, and draw count without adding full-text branches
- test proving first-sentence `and` composition separates external deck rule from start-of-game runtime effect
- composition-level fail-closed test where one clause in the `and`-joined first sentence is unsupported or only partially parsed while the other clause is valid, proving the full representative support result remains unsupported
- test proving external deck-rule evidence has no runtime capability IDs while start-of-game and Activate Main clauses do
- fail-closed test when start-of-game runtime capability evidence is absent
- fail-closed test when Activate Main runtime capability evidence is absent
- fail-closed test when deck-rule parser certification evidence is absent or stale
- regression tests for SUP-003E, SUP-003F, SUP-003G representative rows through the production/default path
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/cards test`
- `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- representative full leader text succeeds only through composition of SUP-003E, SUP-003F, and SUP-003G primitives
- generated-support proof distinguishes non-runtime deck-rule evidence from runtime start-of-game and Activate Main evidence
- parse completeness passes only when every gameplay-relevant clause is either runtime-supported or certified non-runtime
- generated-support tests that assert `status: supported` must validate every produced Effect DSL block with the real schema validator
- production/default support-evaluator and support-probe paths have no missing parser-certification blockers for the scoped representative composition
- fail-closed tests prove unsupported or uncertified variants do not become playable because another clause is supported
- no production code checks exact full card text, card IDs, or one representative sample as a whole string

## Post-Approval Role Sections

### implementation

Responsibilities
- implement only the approved story using packet authority order
- follow strict TypeScript, lint, and verification requirements
- report ambiguity instead of inventing uncited behavior

Forbidden Actions
- do not broaden scope beyond the approved story boundary or allowed_touch_points
- do not add packet extraction behavior unless the approved story explicitly owns it
- do not implement story-author/story-review handoff mechanics

Required Inputs
- active packet content with authoritative spec references
- approved story scope, non-scope, and acceptance criteria
- allowed_touch_points and required test list

Required Outputs
- scoped code and test changes within approved touch points
- verification command results with pass/fail status
- assumptions and blockers note

Verification Checklist
- confirm required inputs are present and current
- confirm forbidden actions are not introduced
- confirm required outputs are produced for handoff

### code-review

Responsibilities
- review correctness, scope fit, and required-test coverage
- verify no forbidden role sections or lifecycle changes were introduced
- confirm canonical packet behavior remains enforceable

Forbidden Actions
- do not author new feature scope outside the reviewed patch
- do not bypass required tests, packet verification, or CI gate evidence
- do not approve scope drift that violates story boundary

Required Inputs
- proposed patch limited to approved touch points
- active packet, approved story, and cited spec references
- verification and test evidence for required commands

Required Outputs
- review findings prioritized by correctness and scope compliance
- clear disposition for findings (fix/defer/block) with rationale
- review closure recommendation for Session Orchestrator handoff

Verification Checklist
- confirm required inputs are present and current
- confirm forbidden actions are not introduced
- confirm required outputs are produced for handoff

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
