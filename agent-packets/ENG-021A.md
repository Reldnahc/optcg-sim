## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s017 (Battle sequence)

A battle is a sub-state inside Main Phase.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s021 (Damage Step)

1. Compute attacker and target power from `ComputedGameView`.
2. If attacker power is lower than target power, no damage/K.O. occurs.
3. If attacker power is equal or greater:
   - Target Leader: deal damage.
   - Target Character: K.O. target.
4. Emit events for damage, life movement, K.O., card movement.
5. Triggered effects during damage wait until damage processing completes.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s022 (End of Battle)

1. Queue/resolve end-of-battle triggers.
2. Expire battle-duration continuous effects.
3. Clear battle context.
4. Return to Main Phase.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s023 (Damage processing)

For each point of damage:

1. If player has 0 life, mark defeat condition and run rule processing.
2. Otherwise, take the top life card.
3. If the card has `[Trigger]`, ask whether to reveal and activate it instead of adding it to hand.
4. If trigger is activated, the card is temporarily in no zone while the trigger resolves.
5. After trigger resolution, trash the card unless the trigger or a replacement says otherwise.
6. If trigger is declined or unavailable, add the card to hand hidden.

When damage is greater than 1, repeat this process one point at a time in official order.

`[Banish]` replaces the normal life-to-hand/trigger path by trashing the life card instead.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s004 (Engine result)

Every engine call returns a result object rather than only the new state.

```ts
interface EngineResult {
  state: GameState;
  events: EngineEvent[];
  decisions?: PendingDecision[];
  errors?: EngineError[];
  stateHash: string;
}
```

For normal play there should be at most one active `pendingDecision` at a time. Tests may use arrays to inspect internal generated decisions.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s021 (Invariant hooks)

Run invariants after every accepted action and after every effect resolution in tests/dev.

Required invariants:

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertZoneOwnershipIsValid(state);
assertAttachedDonExistsAndBelongsToController(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertNoNegativeZoneCounts(state);
assertPendingDecisionHasLegalResponses(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesHaveValidSourcesOrPolicies(state);
assertHiddenInfoNotPresentInPlayerViews(state);
```

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only the supported engine-core End of Battle cleanup path used by current vanilla, Character K.O., Blocker, Counter, and Banish battle resolution. Do not add new card effects, new legal actions, unsupported timing windows, production replay schema, or server/client/UI behavior.

## Scope

- introduce an explicit End of Battle cleanup helper or equivalent centralized function for supported battle resolution
- route existing supported battle resolution exits through the centralized cleanup path instead of duplicating battle-clear event and state mutation logic
- ensure battle context is cleared only by the centralized cleanup path after supported damage or no-damage comparison work completes
- preserve existing public/replay-only event visibility, event ordering, event IDs, state hashing, rule-processing, and invariant behavior
- preserve existing fail-closed behavior for unsupported pending runtime work, replacement state, continuous effects, unsupported timing effects, Life Triggers, On K.O., protection, and unsupported keywords

## Out of Scope

- thisBattle continuous-effect support or expiration beyond preserving current behavior
- new card effects or new effect-runtime DSL primitives
- Life Triggers, On K.O., replacement effects, protection effects, or End of Battle trigger resolution
- new legal actions
- production replay schema, rollback, recovery, server/client/UI, database, or CLI behavior

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-021A packet while implementing this story
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify before implementation and review handoff
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-021 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- if implementation requires new effect behavior, split or record the blocker
- implementation-review gate is required after the PR is opened
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- add or update packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts coverage proving supported Leader damage and Character K.O. use the cleanup event after damage/K.O. events
- add or update event sequencing assertions for the centralized cleanup path
- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/event-sequencing-regression.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- supported battle resolution has one explicit cleanup helper or equivalent centralized path that appends the End of Battle cleanup event, clears battle context, runs rule processing, appends the event journal, checks invariants, and returns an EngineResult
- no supported battle path deletes `state.battle` before supported timing and damage work has completed
- existing supported vanilla Leader damage and Character K.O. behavior remains unchanged except for intentional internal routing through the cleanup path
- event seq ordering, event ID uniqueness, appended eventJournal suffix equality, and state hash stability are preserved for covered supported paths
- unsupported End of Battle triggers and other unsupported timing/effect work remain fail-closed without mutation
