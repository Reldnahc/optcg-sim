## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s008 (Setup sequence)

Use a deterministic setup flow:

```text
1. Validate decks, card support, format, banlist.
2. Determine first/second player.
3. Build initial full GameState.
4. Resolve start-of-game effects that modify setup.
5. Shuffle decks using recorded RNG.
6. Draw opening hands.
7. Handle official mulligan decisions: each player may once either keep or return all 5 to deck, reshuffle, and redraw 5, in first-player-then-second-player order.
8. Place Life from the top of deck equal to Leader life using the canonical orientation algorithm below.
9. Start first player's Refresh Phase.
```

Start-of-game effects that alter decks must happen before final shuffle and opening draw.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s009 (Canonical Life orientation)

Canonical state convention:

```text
player.deck[0] = top of deck
player.life[0] = top of Life area = next Life card taken for damage
```

Life setup must satisfy the official rule that the card that was on top of the deck becomes the bottom card of the Life area.

Implementation algorithm:

```ts
function setupLifeFromDeck(
  player: PlayerState,
  lifeCount: number,
): PlayerState {
  const takenInDeckOrder = player.deck.slice(0, lifeCount); // [A, B, C], A was top of deck
  const remainingDeck = player.deck.slice(lifeCount);
  const lifeTopFirst = [...takenInDeckOrder]
    .reverse()
    .map((card) => ({ card, faceUp: false }));
  return { ...player, deck: remainingDeck, life: lifeTopFirst };
}
```

Damage always takes `player.life[0]`. Effects that add cards to Life must specify `position: "top" | "bottom"`; if a card text does not specify, use the official ruling for that card and add a card-specific test.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s044 (Confirmed rulings carried forward)

- Effect resolution uses a queue model.
- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are waiting, and resolving A triggers turn player effect C, B resolves before C.
- Simultaneous effects controlled by the same player are ordered by that player.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage processing finishes.
- Effects triggered by card/effect activation resolve after the triggering effect finishes.
- Start-of-game effects can modify the deck before opening draw.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s012 (Cost payment)

```ts
interface PayCostDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "payCost";
  cost: Cost;
  paymentOptions: PaymentOption[];
}

interface PaymentResponse {
  type: "payment";
  optionId: string;
  selectedCardInstanceIds?: InstanceId[];
  selectedDonInstanceIds?: InstanceId[];
}

interface PaymentDeclinedResponse {
  type: "paymentDeclined";
}
```

Optional cost payment uses `PayCostDecision`, not `chooseOptionalActivation`.
Optional cost acceptance uses `PaymentResponse`. Optional cost decline uses
`{ type: "paymentDeclined" }` as the `PaymentDeclinedResponse` payload, with
no `optionId`, selected cards, selected DON!!, decision ID, hidden candidate
details, or reason field inside the response payload. The outer
`respondToDecision.decisionId` identifies the active optional-cost decision.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseQuantity
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

For `chooseQuantity`, the response payload shape is `{ type: "chooseQuantity"; quantity: number }`. The outer `respondToDecision.decisionId` must name the active `chooseQuantity` decision. The inner `ChooseQuantityResponse` payload does not carry a decision ID; it is valid only when it has response type `chooseQuantity` and carries a whole integer `quantity` inside the decision's allowed `min` and `max` bounds.

Cardinality is explicit:

- exact-N decisions use `mode: "exact"` and must be represented with `min: N` and `max: N`; `mode: "exact"` with different `min` and `max` values is malformed and must not be created. A response below the required value, above it, non-integer, negative when the minimum is non-negative, or otherwise out-of-range is an `invalidDecisionResponse`.
- up-to-N decisions use `mode: "upTo"` and allow a partial response from `min` through `max`, inclusive. Choosing `max` is legal. Choosing less than `max` is legal only when it is still at least `min`.
- zero is legal only when the decision's `min` is `0`; exact-0 is represented as `min: 0`, `max: 0`, and `mode: "exact"`.
- minimum and maximum bounds are authoritative. Responses below `min`, above `max`, non-integer, missing, or with the wrong response type are rejected as `invalidDecisionResponse`.

Quantity decisions exposed through legal actions must advertise only public bounds, prompt text, and the active decision ID. They must not reveal hidden candidate counts, must not reveal hidden card identities, and must not encode whether a private candidate set contains a particular card. If a quantity is constrained by hidden information, the engine validates against the private candidate set internally and returns `invalidDecisionResponse` for illegal responses without disclosing the hidden reason through public legal actions or public events.

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

For optional costs, the only canonical decline route is the active
`PayCostDecision` answered with `PaymentDeclinedResponse`; optional cost decline
must not reuse `chooseOptionalActivation` and must not submit a partial
`PaymentResponse`. A stale optional-cost decision ID, malformed optional-cost
response, wrong player response, insufficient payment, response whose
`optionId` is not one of the active `paymentOptions`, or payment selection
outside the active decision context is rejected as `invalidDecisionResponse`.
These failures fail closed: they do not resolve the decision, do not record a
segment result, do not consume once-per-turn usage or other use counters, do not
emit public events describing hidden payment candidates, and must not reveal
hidden payment candidates, private DON!! choices, or internal failure details
through public legal actions, public events, PlayerView, or SpectatorView.
Optional cost payment uses `PayCostDecision`, not `chooseOptionalActivation`.
Optional cost decline uses `{ type: "paymentDeclined" }` and never carries
payment selections.
A rejected optional-cost response does not consume once-per-turn usage.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s023 (Error handling inside the engine)

Engine errors are classified.

```ts
type EngineError =
  | { type: "illegalAction"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invalidDecisionResponse"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invariantViolation"; invariant: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "unsupportedCard"; cardId: CardId; status: CardSupportStatus }
  | { type: "effectRuntimeError"; effectId: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "loopDetected"; signature: LoopSignature };
```

Illegal player actions are rejected and logged. Invariant violations and effect runtime errors freeze or recover the match according to the recovery policy.

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

### 04-effect-runtime.s007 (Source presence policy)

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s003 (Top-level definition)

```ts
interface EffectDefinition {
  cardId: CardId;
  implementationStatus: CardSupportStatus;
  effects: EffectBlock[];
  metadata: EffectDefinitionMetadata;
}

interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  sourceTextHash: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  tested: boolean;
  reviewer?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s006 (Conditions)

```ts
type Condition =
  | { type: "donCount"; target?: Target; min: number }
  | { type: "yourTurn" }
  | { type: "opponentTurn" }
  | { type: "lifeCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "fieldCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "handCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "trashCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "leaderColorCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "hasCardInZone"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter: CardFilter }
  | { type: "attackTarget"; targetType: "leader" | "character" | "any" }
  | { type: "cardState"; target: Target; state: "active" | "rested" }
  | { type: "sourceStillInZone" }
  | { type: "eventPayload"; path: string; op: Comparator; value: unknown }
  | { type: "and"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "or"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "not"; condition: Condition }
  | { type: "custom"; check: string };

type Comparator = "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte";
type PlayerRef =
  | "self"
  | "opponent"
  | "turnPlayer"
  | "nonTurnPlayer"
  | "owner"
  | "controller";
```

`leaderColorCount` is a public Leader metadata condition. It reads only the
player's Leader colors from the match manifest or resolved card snapshot, uses a
canonical `PlayerRef` and `Comparator`, and its `value` is a non-negative safe
integer. Printed "multicolored" Leader conditions map to
`{ type: "leaderColorCount", player: "self", op: "gte", value: 2 }`.

Leader type and Leader attribute conditions do not introduce `leaderType` or
`leaderAttribute` predicates. Represent them through the public Leader Area with
`hasCardInZone` and `CardFilter`, for example
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], typesAny: ["Straw Hat Crew"] } }`
or
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], attributesAny: ["slash"] } }`.
The schema-supported fixture subset admits only this public Leader-zone metadata
form and does not authorize private-zone metadata queries.

Condition, duration, and restriction primitives outside the schema-supported fixture subset remain planned layers. They are contract-defined by this reference, but they are not fixture-authorable until the schema coverage policy lists them as supported.

For public DON-on-field count authorability, use existing `fieldCount` with a
DON filter (`filter.categories` containing `"don"`), canonical comparator, and
non-negative threshold. In this DON filter form, schema fixtures support
`player: "self"` and `player: "opponent"` only, and reject free-text shortcuts.
This is contract/schema authorability evidence only and does not by itself imply
runtime executable support, parser certification, generated support, or card
playability.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s014 (Search request)

```ts
interface SearchRequest {
  zone: "deck" | "trash" | "life";
  player: PlayerRef;
  lookCount?: number;
  filter: CardFilter;
  min: number;
  max: number;
  destination: Zone;
  revealTo: Visibility;
  remainingCards?: {
    destination: Zone;
    position: "top" | "bottom";
    order: "ownerChoice" | "random";
  };
  shuffleAfter?: boolean;
}
```

### 06-visibility-security.s004 (PlayerView shape)

```ts
interface PlayerView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  self: VisiblePlayerState;
  opponent: OpponentVisibleState;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PublicDecision;
  legalActions: PublicLegalAction[];
  revealedCards: PublicRevealRecord[];
  events: EngineEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Do not include:

- Deck order.
- Opponent hand card IDs.
- Face-down life card IDs.
- RNG seed/internal state.
- Effect queue internals.
- Private decision candidates not visible to recipient.
- Internal crash/recovery metadata.

Canonical public support DTOs for the initial live view contract:

```ts
type SpectatorPolicy = {
  mode: "disabled" | "live-filtered";
  allowHandRevealAfterGame: boolean;
};

interface PublicTurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}

interface PublicBattleState {
  attacker: CardRef;
  originalTarget: CardRef;
  currentTarget: CardRef;
  blocker?: CardRef;
  step: BattleStep;
  damageCount: number;
}

interface PublicCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  attachedDonCount: number;
  turnPlayed?: number;
}

interface PublicLifeView {
  count: number;
  faceUpCards: PublicCardView[];
}

interface VisiblePlayerState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  hand: PublicCardView[];
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

interface OpponentVisibleState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  handCount: number;
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

type SpectatorVisiblePlayerState = OpponentVisibleState;

interface PublicDecision {
  id: DecisionId;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

type PublicLegalAction =
  | { type: "playCard"; card: CardRef; costPaymentRequired?: boolean }
  | { type: "activateEffect"; source: CardRef; effectId: EffectId }
  | { type: "attachDon"; don: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; card: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }

interface PublicRevealRecord {
  id: string;
  cards: CardRef[];
  visibility: "public" | "privateToRecipient";
  origin: ZoneRef | "topOfDeck" | "lifeDamage" | "custom";
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  cleanupPolicy: "returnToOrigin" | "trashAfterResolution" | "none";
}

type SpectatorRevealRecord = Omit<PublicRevealRecord, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: "public";
};

type SpectatorEvent = Omit<EngineEvent, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: { type: "public" };
};
```

Initial live-filtered spectator view is distinct from `PlayerView`:

```ts
interface SpectatorView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  spectatorPolicy: SpectatorPolicy;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, SpectatorVisiblePlayerState>;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  revealedCards: SpectatorRevealRecord[];
  events: SpectatorEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Initial `SpectatorView` has no `pendingDecision` or `legalActions` field.
It does not include either player's hand card IDs, deck order, face-down life
card IDs, private reveal records, non-public events, RNG state, effect queue
internals, or audit entries. Full-information live spectating is deferred to a
future explicit policy story.

### 06-visibility-security.s005 (Temporary visibility)

Some events reveal hidden cards temporarily.

| Event                    | Who sees                                        | Duration                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Playing card from hand   | Both players                                    | Reveal through placement/resolution            |
| Counter card from hand   | Both players                                    | Reveal through trash/effect resolution         |
| Activated life trigger   | Both players                                    | Reveal through trigger resolution              |
| Declined life trigger    | Nobody except server                            | Never shown                                    |
| Search/look at deck      | Searching player only unless effect says reveal | During effect resolution                       |
| Effect reveals hand/life | As specified by effect                          | During effect resolution or specified duration |
| Trash from hidden zone   | Public once in trash                            | From arrival in trash onward                   |

```ts
interface RevealRecord {
  id: string;
  card: CardRef;
  sourceZone: Zone;
  reason:
    | "play"
    | "counter"
    | "trigger"
    | "search"
    | "lookAt"
    | "effect"
    | "trash";
  visibleTo: "both" | PlayerId[] | "replayOnly";
  expires: RevealExpiration;
}
```

The engine must remove expired `RevealRecord`s as part of effect cleanup.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Engine runtime story only. Do not add card parser/generated-support behavior, real-card fixture evidence, support manifests, source hashes, behavior hashes, or contract/schema changes.

## Scope

- support setup-time effect blocks with trigger `startOfGame` that select up to 1 card from the source controller's deck using scoped Stage category/type filters
- support playing at most one selected Stage card from deck into the source controller's stage area without paying cost
- execute the scoped start-of-game effect before final shuffle, opening draw, mulligan decisions, and Life setup as required by `02-engine-mechanics.s008`
- preserve deterministic RNG, deck order, zone indexing, event ordering, and state hashes across setup
- create hidden-info-safe owner decisions when a choice is required and allow selecting zero cards for `up to 1`
- ensure selected Stage cards become public in stage area and unselected deck card identities remain hidden from the opponent
- if the player already controls a Stage during setup, trash the existing Stage before placing the selected Stage using the ENG-005B Stage replacement ordering and fail closed if that replacement path cannot be represented safely
- produce engine test evidence for setup timing and hidden-information behavior that later cards-layer runtime capability records can cite; do not edit the cards runtime capability matrix in this engine story

## Out of Scope

- shared contract/schema changes
- card parser, generated-support, runtime capability matrix edits in cards package, support reports, fixtures, overlays, card IDs, source hashes, or behavior hashes
- deck validation or leader-scoped construction restrictions
- start-of-game effects that search trash, hand, life, DON deck, opponent deck, or arbitrary zones
- start-of-game effects that reveal, add to hand, trash, shuffle after search, play Characters, play Events, select more than one Stage, or play multiple unrelated categories
- broad setup queue ordering among multiple simultaneous start-of-game effects beyond deterministic owner/turn-order behavior needed for the scoped tests
- server, client, UI, database, API, or live card-data work

## Constraints

- implement only SUP-003D while its packet is active
- do not activate or implement SUP-003D until SUP-002D search runtime evidence has landed on main or the active parent integration branch
- keep engine-core free of cards package imports and live card-data adapters
- stop and split if setup-time start-of-game effects require new shared contract fields
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- engine setup test proving a start-of-game typed Stage can be selected from deck and played before opening hand and Life setup
- engine setup test proving selected Stage is excluded from final shuffled deck and cannot appear in opening hand or Life
- engine setup/mulligan regression proving the setup flow now matches `02-engine-mechanics.s008` ordering without redrawing the played Stage during mulligan
- engine setup test proving zero selection is legal and deterministic
- engine hidden-information/view test for owner-only deck candidates and public played Stage
- engine test varying type filter and deck position without changing runtime path
- engine test for no matching Stage and insufficient candidates
- engine malformed/stale/wrong-player response tests for setup selection
- engine test proving an occupied Stage is trashed before the selected setup Stage is placed, and invalid replacement state fails closed without mutation
- deterministic event-order and state-hash tests for selected and declined setup branches
- regression test proving normal setup without start-of-game effects remains compatible
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core test`
- `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- scoped start-of-game effects run before opening draw, mulligan, and Life setup
- selecting a matching Stage removes it from deck and places it in the player's stage area before final shuffle/opening draw
- selecting zero cards is legal for up-to cardinality and leaves deck/stage unchanged except for recorded decision resolution
- setup decisions expose candidates only to the choosing player and do not leak unselected deck identity to the opponent
- tests vary type name and deck position to prove no exact branch; selection count remains capped at up to one because Stage Area is a single-slot zone
- deck order, zone indexing, RNG advancement, event sequence, and final state hash are deterministic
- insufficient matching cards, no matching cards, malformed responses, wrong-player responses, stale decisions, and destination conflicts fail closed or resolve as specified without hidden-info leaks
- no engine code imports `@optcg/cards` or checks real card IDs or exact printed text
