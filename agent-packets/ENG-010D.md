# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-010D
Epic ID: M1-001
Title: Route start-of-main runtime fail-closed path through scaffold
Type: implementation
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Replace existing ad hoc effect-queue and deferred-trigger fail-closed checks in the start-of-main path with the shared runtime scaffold, while preserving current known-trigger-free Main Phase behavior.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s003 (Rule-processing checkpoints)

Run rule processing after every atomic state change, not only after player actions.

```ts
function afterAtomicMutation(result: EngineStepResult): EngineStepResult {
  const checked = checkRuleProcessing(result.state);
  return { ...result, state: checked };
}
```

Rule processing checks:

- Leader damage when that player has 0 life.
- Deck-out at a rule-processing checkpoint.
- Effect-created win/loss conditions.
- Simultaneous loss resulting in draw.
- Invariant violations in development/test mode.

Concession is immediate and cannot be replaced or prevented.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s014 (Main Phase)

Before the turn player receives action priority, emit `phaseStarted(main)`, collect `[Start of Main Phase]` triggers, and resolve required automatic effects. If any pending decision is created, Main Phase action priority does not begin until that decision and the resulting queue are complete.

Turn player may repeatedly:

- Play a Character, Stage, or `[Main]` Event from hand.
- Activate `[Activate: Main]` effects.
- Give active DON!! to Leader or Characters.
- Declare an attack, if legal.
- End the phase.

Neither player can attack on their first turn.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s021 (Invariant hooks)

Run invariants after every accepted action and after every effect resolution in tests/dev.

Required invariants:

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertZoneOwnershipIsValid(state);
assertAttachedDonExistsAndBelongsToController(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertNoNegativeZoneCounts(state);
assertPendingDecisionHasLegalResponses(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesHaveValidSourcesOrPolicies(state);
assertHiddenInfoNotPresentInPlayerViews(state);
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s022 (Internal state sequencing)

```ts
type StateSeq = number & { __brand: "StateSeq" };

interface TurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}
```

Increment `state.seq` after every accepted action or resolved decision, not after every internal event. Internal events have their own sequence inside the event journal.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s023 (Error handling inside the engine)

Engine errors are classified.

```ts
type EngineError =
  | { type: "illegalAction"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invalidDecisionResponse"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invariantViolation"; invariant: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "unsupportedCard"; cardId: CardId; status: CardSupportStatus }
  | { type: "effectRuntimeError"; effectId: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "loopDetected"; signature: LoopSignature };
```

Illegal player actions are rejected and logged. Invariant violations and effect runtime errors freeze or recover the match according to the recovery policy.

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only integration of the ENG-010B runtime scaffold into existing start-of-main fail-closed paths. Stop before changing battle, play-card, replay fixtures, trigger detection, queue execution, event sequencing, legal-action gating, or blocker/counter/trigger/replacement/effect decisions.

## Scope

- update `enterMainPhase` to use the shared effect-runtime scaffold for non-empty `effectQueue` and `deferredTriggers` rejection while preserving current `effectRuntimeError` classification and no-mutation behavior
- preserve accepted known-trigger-free start-of-main behavior

## Out of Scope

- changing any accepted vanilla behavior
- changing event id format, event seq allocation, event visibility, state sequence increments, state hash behavior, rule-processing timing, or invariant timing
- implementing trigger detection, queue execution, source-presence policy, blocker, counter, life triggers, Event effects, On Play effects, replacement, continuous effects, or once-per-turn tracking
- changing battle actions, play-card behavior, replay fixtures, replay validation, or replay smoke hashes
- changing legal-action gating
- changing replay schema, CLI grammar, server protocol, browser UI, database, Redis, WebSocket, React, live HTTP, or Poneglyph behavior

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/phases.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/phases.test.ts

## Constraints

- keep the patch behavior-preserving; if any state hash, replay hash, event sequence, event id, legal action, pending decision, or existing test expectation changes, stop and split or record the ambiguity
- fail closed on ambiguous timing-window, source-presence, trigger ordering, hidden-information, or replay behavior
- keep engine-core deterministic and pure
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- existing `packages/engine-core/src/phases.test.ts` start-of-main queue/deferred-trigger rejection tests must pass with updated assertions proving ENG-010B sentinel `effectId` and details are used
- existing known-trigger-free start-of-main tests in `packages/engine-core/src/phases.test.ts` must pass with unchanged assertions
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck` must pass
- `corepack pnpm run verify` must pass

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- start-of-main non-empty `effectQueue` and `deferredTriggers` fail through the shared runtime scaffold with ENG-010B sentinel `effectId` and details, while preserving `effectRuntimeError` classification and unchanged no-mutation behavior
- current accepted known-trigger-free start-of-main behavior is unchanged

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
