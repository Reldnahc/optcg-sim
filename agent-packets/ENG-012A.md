# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-012A
Epic ID: M1-001
Title: Add match-local effect definition registry contract
Type: implementation
Area: types
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Add the missing match-local authority surface that lets engine-core resolve `implemented-dsl` card support records to immutable effect definitions without live card-data access.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 04-effect-runtime.s002 (Overview)

The effect runtime executes effect definitions against the authoritative game state.

```text
Effect definitions        Runtime                 Engine core
DSL + custom handlers --> queue/choices/events --> atomic state mutations
```

The runtime must preserve timing, hidden information, source-presence rules, replacement effects, and deterministic replay.

**v6 contract:** queue entries, decisions, replacement state, and continuous-effect records are defined in [`contracts/canonical-types.ts`](contracts/canonical-types.ts). The algorithms below are normative when they are more precise than older snippets.

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s001 (Effect DSL Reference)

Effect definitions are keyed by **Poneglyph base card ID**. Poneglyph supplies the printed card text and metadata; the simulator DSL supplies executable rule behavior. The DSL should store a source-text hash so a Poneglyph text change can trigger implementation review.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s003 (Top-level definition)

```ts
interface EffectDefinition {
  cardId: CardId;
  implementationStatus: CardSupportStatus;
  effects: EffectBlock[];
  metadata: EffectDefinitionMetadata;
}

interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  sourceTextHash: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  tested: boolean;
  reviewer?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s004 (Effect block)

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string;
  category: "auto" | "activate" | "permanent" | "replacement";
  trigger: Trigger;
  condition?: Condition;
  conditionTiming?: "activation" | "resolution" | "both";
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s019 (Example: On Play draw 1)

```json
{
  "cardId": "OP01-015",
  "implementationStatus": "implemented-dsl",
  "effects": [
    {
      "id": "OP01-015:auto-on-play-1",
      "category": "auto",
      "trigger": { "type": "onPlay" },
      "optional": false,
      "oncePerTurn": false,
      "sourcePresencePolicy": "mustRemainInSameZone",
      "effect": { "type": "draw", "count": 1, "player": "self" }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "sourceTextHash": "sha256:...",
    "rulesVersion": "2026-01-16",
    "effectDefinitionsVersion": "0.1.0",
    "tested": true
  }
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s029 (Schema coverage policy)

`contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` is the executable JSON fixture contract.
TypeScript/spec primitives outside that JSON schema are planned/not
fixture-authorable until schema validation and fixtures exist.

Schema-supported fixture subset:

- trigger: onPlay
- trigger: whenAttacking
- trigger: onOpponentAttack
- trigger: onBlock
- trigger: onKO
- trigger: endOfYourTurn
- trigger: endOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: trigger
- trigger: activateMain
- trigger: main
- trigger: counter
- trigger: permanent
- trigger: startOfGame
- trigger: startOfYourTurn
- trigger: startOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: startOfMainPhase
- trigger: endOfBattle
- trigger: donAttach
- trigger: custom
- condition: yourTurn
- condition: attachedDonCount
- cost: restDon
- cost: restSelf
- cost: sequence
- target: self, myLeader, opponentLeader, attacker, attackTarget, blocker,
  triggerCard, all, choose
- duration: thisAction, thisBattle, thisTurn, whileSourceOnField, permanent
- effect: draw
- effect: ko
- effect: modifyPower
- effect: sequence
- effect: custom
- card filters: cardIds, names, nameContains, nameNot, categories, colorsAny,
  colorsAll, typesAny, typesAll, attributesAny, attributesAll, cost, power,
  counter, hasKeywords, lacksKeywords, state, owner, controller, excludeSelf,
  custom

Planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage exists:

- condition: donCount
- condition: opponentTurn
- condition: lifeCount
- condition: fieldCount
- condition: handCount
- condition: trashCount
- condition: hasCardInZone
- condition: attackTarget
- condition: cardState
- condition: sourceStillInZone
- condition: eventPayload
- condition: and, or, not, custom
- cost: returnDon
- cost: trashFromHand
- cost: trashSelf
- cost: trashFromField
- cost: discard
- cost: chooseOne
- cost: custom
- duration: untilEndOfTurn
- duration: untilStartOfNextTurn
- duration: whileConditionTrue
- effect: drawUpTo
- effect: search
- effect: lookAtTop
- effect: revealFromZone
- effect: revealTop
- effect: selectFromSet
- effect: selectCards
- effect: moveSelected with position
- effect: putRemaining
- effect: shuffleDeck
- effect: bounce
- effect: trash
- effect: play
- effect: playSelected
- effect: returnUnselectedToDeck
- effect: trashFromHand
- effect: setPowerToZero
- effect: setBasePower
- effect: modifyCost
- effect: setBaseCost
- effect: rest
- effect: activate
- effect: giveKeyword
- effect: removeKeyword
- effect: addDon
- effect: attachDon
- effect: returnDon
- effect: addLife
- effect: damage
- effect: invalidateEffects
- effect: protectFromKO
- effect: cannotAttack
- effect: cannotBlock
- effect: cannotBeAttacked
- effect: cannotBeBlockedBy
- effect: choice
- effect: conditional
- effect: forEachMatch
- effect: repeat
- effect: replacement

new fixture-authorable primitives must add schema coverage and validation fixtures in the same story that makes the primitive authorable.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only the type/contract shape for carrying reviewed effect definitions in match-local data and the fixture/type tests proving the shape. Stop before engine-core loads, validates, queues, or executes effects.

## Scope

- add a deterministic match-local effect definition registry to the canonical manifest/type surface using existing `EffectDefinition` and `CardImplementationRecord.effectDefinitionId` authority
- require every registry entry to be serializable and keyed by the stable `CardImplementationRecord.effectDefinitionId` lookup key
- require each registry entry's `EffectDefinition.cardId` to remain the Poneglyph base card ID and match the corresponding support record's `cardId` when a support record points at that definition
- preserve existing resolved-card support metadata and `effectDefinitionsVersion`
- add type/export cohesion coverage for the new manifest field
- keep existing fixtures valid by defaulting to an empty registry where no effects are present

## Out of Scope

- engine-core effect lookup or validation
- trigger detection
- effect queue entry creation
- draw primitive execution
- play-card integration
- replay schema changes beyond the canonical serializable state/manifest shape
- live Poneglyph/card-data access

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- contracts/canonical-types.ts
- packages/types/src/card-metadata.ts
- packages/types/src/card-metadata.test.ts
- packages/types/src/export-cohesion.test.ts
- packages/types/src/export-ownership.manifest.ts
- tests/contracts/**
- fixtures/effect-dsl/**

## Constraints

- do not introduce broad type assertions, `any`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-nocheck`
- do not introduce engine-core behavior in this story
- fail closed if the canonical manifest authority is ambiguous
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

## Required Tests

- package type test compiling a `MatchCardManifest` with an empty effect definition registry
- package type test compiling a `MatchCardManifest` with an `implemented-dsl` card whose support `effectDefinitionId` points at a reviewed On Play draw definition
- export cohesion/ownership coverage for any newly exported type surface
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/types typecheck` must pass
- `corepack pnpm run verify` must pass

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- `MatchCardManifest` can carry reviewed `EffectDefinition` records keyed by `CardImplementationRecord.effectDefinitionId`
- `EffectDefinition.cardId` remains the Poneglyph base card ID inside each registry entry
- vanilla manifests can represent an empty effect definition registry
- type/export tests prove the new registry is part of the package contract
- contract tests and fixture validation remain green

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text

Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
