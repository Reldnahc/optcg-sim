# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-036B
Epic ID: KICK-001
Title: Extract trigger source lookup helpers
Type: refactor
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Extract trigger source lookup, event matching, zone-ref parsing, and snapshot helpers from effect-runtime-trigger-queueing.ts without changing trigger queueing behavior, fail-closed errors, queue entries, events, or state hashes.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 04-effect-runtime.s006 (Effect queue entry)

```ts
interface EffectQueueEntry {
  id: QueueEntryId;
  state: "pending" | "resolving" | "resolved" | "cancelled";
  timingWindowId: TimingWindowId;
  generation: number;
  controllerId: PlayerId;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  triggerEventId?: EngineEventId;
  effectBlockId: EffectId;
  orderingGroup: "turnPlayer" | "nonTurnPlayer";
  createdAtEventSeq: number;
  queuedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  sourcePresencePolicy: SourcePresencePolicy;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s007 (Source presence policy)

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

### 04-effect-runtime.s008 (Trigger detection from events)

Trigger detection consumes event batches.

```ts
function detectTriggeredEffects(
  state: GameState,
  events: EngineEvent[],
): TriggerCandidate[] {
  const candidates: TriggerCandidate[] = [];

  for (const event of events) {
    candidates.push(...findAutoEffectsForEvent(state, event));
    candidates.push(...findReplacementFollowupsIfAny(state, event));
  }

  return candidates.filter((c) => canTriggerNow(c, state));
}
```

The engine must check source presence before queueing, then apply the queue entry's source-presence policy before resolution.

### 04-effect-runtime.s016 (Failure policy)

```ts
type FailurePolicy =
  | "doAsMuchAsPossible"
  | "requiresAll"
  | "skipIfNoLegalTarget"
  | "optionalIfPossible";
```

Default is `doAsMuchAsPossible`, unless a connector or card text requires dependency.

### 06-visibility-security.s006 (Effect event visibility)

The game log can leak information if not filtered.

```ts
interface EffectEvent {
  id: string;
  sourceCardId: CardId;
  sourceInstanceId?: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  description: string;
  choices?: PublicChoiceSummary;
  visibleTo: "both" | PlayerId[] | "replayOnly";
}
```

Examples:

- Public target selection: visible to both.
- Searching deck: opponent sees "Opponent is searching deck" and maybe count, not card IDs.
- Choosing a card from hand to trash: opponent sees the resulting public trash card, not pre-choice hand options.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Package-boundary enforcement is required, not optional.

At minimum, lint rules or dependency-cruiser / equivalent boundary tooling must enforce:

- `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.
- `@optcg/view-engine` cannot import hidden-information-only server modules.
- `@optcg/client` cannot import server-only packages.
- `@optcg/server` cannot bypass `@optcg/cards` to call card-data sources directly from engine execution paths.
- test helpers that expose hidden state cannot be imported into browser/client production bundles.
- replay validation code cannot depend on client rendering code.

If stronger tooling is adopted, such as dependency-cruiser, Knip, or custom graph checks, CI must fail on violations.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only behavior-preserving production helper extraction for source lookup and event interpretation used by trigger queueing. Do not move trigger category queueing bodies in this story.

## Scope

- move existing card instance lookup helpers, trash lookup, attack-event source matching, zone-ref parsing, K.O. move-event matching, source snapshot creation, and field trigger source enumeration into effect-runtime-trigger-source-lookup.ts
- preserve all returned values, undefined cases, error paths, object shapes, and ordering
- keep trigger queueing category functions in effect-runtime-trigger-queueing.ts except for imports from the new helper module
- update package-internal imports only as required by the extraction

## Out of Scope

- changing trigger category queueing behavior
- changing source-presence policy or supported effect shape checks
- changing queue processing behavior
- adding new exported public API beyond package-internal helper exports
- changing tests except where imports or focused test names require updates

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-036B packet while implementing this story
- target the ENG-036 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- this is a behavior-preserving production refactor story; if any behavior delta appears, stop and split or record an ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- effect-runtime-trigger-source-lookup.ts owns source lookup and event interpretation helpers used by trigger queueing
- effect-runtime-trigger-queueing.ts behavior and existing exported helpers remain compatible
- no error, event, queue entry, ordering, state hash, or visibility output changes
- focused trigger queueing tests, coverage, and full verify pass

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
