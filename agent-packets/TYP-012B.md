# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: TYP-012B
Epic ID: TYP-012
Title: Conditional continuous protection and keyword DSL authorability
Type: implementation
Area: contracts
Primary Concern: contract

## Why

Reopen the TYP-012 field-removal protection line with the missing Effect DSL authorability needed for reusable conditional continuous protection and keyword-grant definitions. This story records the contract and schema work that must exist before CARD stories can truthfully promote recognized card text into playable generated support.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

Optionality has three distinct meanings:

- Optional activation asks whether the player commits to resolving the effect block. Declining optional activation means the effect block is not legally committed and once-per-turn usage is not consumed.
- Optional cost asks whether the player pays a non-mandatory cost inside an otherwise committed effect. Declining or failing an optional cost records `paidCost: false` and only skips later instructions whose connector or text depends on that cost being paid.
- Optional effect clause asks whether the player performs a non-mandatory instruction during resolution. Declining an optional effect clause records `playerDeclined: true` for that segment and does not undo prior legally completed segments.

Optional cost clauses inside composed execution are not effect-block activation
costs. They occur after legal commitment to the effect block, inside a
resumable sequence segment. Optional cost accept, decline, and failure do not
consume once-per-turn usage because usage was consumed at legal commitment
before the optional cost clause executes. Accepted optional costs pay cost
atomically and emit the normal cost-payment events. Declined optional costs do
not emit cost-payment events. Failed optional costs emit no public event that
reveals hidden payment candidates or private payment details.

Accepted optional cost records `attempted: true`, `succeeded: true`,
`paidCost: true`, and `playerDeclined: false`; `changedState` records whether
canonical state actually changed. Declined optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: true`. Failed optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: false`. Optional cost accept, decline,
and failure do not consume once-per-turn usage, and dependent connectors use
`paidCost` rather than optional-activation state.
Event `seq` values and `state.seq` advancement remain deterministic for
optional cost accept, decline, and failure. State hashes include the frame
segment result for each branch.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s013 (Replacement effects)

Replacement effects intercept replaceable processes.

```ts
interface ReplacementProcess {
  id: string;
  type: ReplaceableProcessType;
  source?: CardRef;
  target?: CardRef;
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  usedReplacementIds: string[];
}
```

Processing order:

1. Replacements generated by the card/process being replaced, if applicable.
2. Turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.
3. Non-turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.

A replacement cannot apply twice to the same replacement process. If a replacement cannot actually perform its replacement, it does not apply.

```ts
function executeReplaceableProcess(
  state: GameState,
  process: ReplacementProcess,
): EngineStepResult {
  let current = process;
  let currentState = state;

  while (true) {
    const replacements = findApplicableReplacements(currentState, current)
      .filter((r) => !current.usedReplacementIds.includes(r.id))
      .filter((r) => canApplyReplacement(r, currentState, current));

    if (replacements.length === 0) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    const choice = chooseReplacementByPriorityOrDecision(
      currentState,
      replacements,
      current,
    );

    if (choice.pausedForDecision) {
      return choice.result;
    }

    if (!choice.chosen) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    current = {
      ...transformProcessByReplacement(choice.chosen, currentState, current),
      usedReplacementIds: [...current.usedReplacementIds, choice.chosen.id],
    };

    currentState = emitReplacementApplied(
      currentState,
      choice.chosen,
      current,
    ).state;
  }
}
```

Replacement decisions use `PendingDecision.chooseReplacement`. Optional replacements may be declined; mandatory replacements cannot be declined unless more than one mandatory replacement requires a controller-chosen order. A replacement cannot apply twice to the same `process.id`, even if the process is transformed into a new shape.

Every applied replacement emits `replacementApplied` with the original process ID, selected replacement ID, old process payload hash, and transformed process payload hash. This event is at least `replayOnly` and may be public when the replacement effect is public.

### 04-effect-runtime.s014 (Continuous effects as computed view)

Continuous and permanent effects do not mutate canonical state on every recalculation. They generate modifiers, and a computed view applies them.

```ts
interface ContinuousEffectRecord {
  id: string;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  controller: PlayerId;
  modifier: Modifier;
  duration: Duration;
  condition?: Condition;
  createdBy: CausalityRef;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

interface Modifier {
  layer: ModifierLayer;
  target: TargetSpec;
  operation: ModifierOperation;
}

type ModifierLayer =
  | "basePowerSet"
  | "baseCostSet"
  | "powerAdd"
  | "costAdd"
  | "keywordAdd"
  | "keywordRemove"
  | "restriction"
  | "protection";
```

Computing a view:

```ts
function computeView(state: GameState): ComputedGameView {
  const base = buildBaseView(state);
  const activeModifiers = collectActiveContinuousEffects(state);
  return applyModifierLayers(base, activeModifiers, state.turn.turnPlayerId);
}
```

Permanent effects may depend on the computed state. If the official rule requires fixed-point behavior, implement the fixed-point over computed views, not by writing current power/cost into canonical state.

exact-card continuous-effect target binding uses `TargetSpec` shape `{ type: "exactCard"; card: CardRef; binding: SavedFieldObjectTargetBinding; createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq }`. A duration-bearing modifier created from a chosen target resolves the saved field-object reference once, stores the exact card target in the `ContinuousEffectRecord`, and does not re-run the original `choose` target during computed-view recalculation. The modifier remains bound to the same card instance while that instance remains legal for the modifier and the duration; if the object is stale, gone, hidden, or illegal, the modifier fails closed without leaking hidden identities.

### 04-effect-runtime.s015 (Duration expiration)

| Duration               | Expiration point                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `thisBattle`           | End of Battle                                                 |
| `thisTurn`             | End Phase cleanup                                             |
| `untilEndOfTurn`       | End Phase cleanup                                             |
| `untilStartOfNextTurn` | Start of specified player's next Refresh Phase                |
| `whileSourceOnField`   | When source leaves required zone                              |
| `whileConditionTrue`   | Not active when condition false; removed or ignored by policy |
| `permanent`            | Only for true game-permanent changes; avoid for field buffs   |

### 04-effect-runtime.s016 (Failure policy)

```ts
type FailurePolicy =
  | "doAsMuchAsPossible"
  | "requiresAll"
  | "skipIfNoLegalTarget"
  | "optionalIfPossible";
```

Default is `doAsMuchAsPossible`, unless a connector or card text requires dependency.

For composed execution, failure policy applies to the whole effect block and to each segment through its connector:

- `doAsMuchAsPossible` attempts each supported segment and records per-segment success without rolling back successful independent segments.
- `requiresAll` fails the composed execution before mutation when any required segment cannot legally complete.
- `skipIfNoLegalTarget` skips the composed execution when required activation-time or first required resolution-time targets are absent.
- `optionalIfPossible` offers the optional instruction only when at least one legal execution path exists; if none exists, the segment is not attempted and does not create a decision.

Unsupported composed runtime shapes default to fail-closed rather than degrading to partial execution. Ambiguous connector dependency, saved-reference lifetime, optionality boundary, target visibility, pending-decision continuation, or replacement interaction must be treated as unsupported until the spec and capability matrix authorize it.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s003 (Top-level definition)

```ts
interface EffectDefinition {
  cardId: CardId;
  implementationStatus: CardSupportStatus;
  effects: EffectBlock[];
  metadata: EffectDefinitionMetadata;
}

interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  sourceTextHash: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  tested: boolean;
  reviewer?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s004 (Effect block)

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string;
  category: "auto" | "activate" | "permanent" | "replacement";
  trigger: Trigger;
  condition?: Condition;
  conditionTiming?: "activation" | "resolution" | "both";
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s006 (Conditions)

```ts
type Condition =
  | { type: "donCount"; target?: Target; min: number }
  | { type: "yourTurn" }
  | { type: "opponentTurn" }
  | { type: "lifeCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "fieldCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "handCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "trashCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "leaderColorCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "hasCardInZone"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter: CardFilter }
  | { type: "attackTarget"; targetType: "leader" | "character" | "any" }
  | { type: "cardState"; target: Target; state: "active" | "rested" }
  | { type: "sourceStillInZone" }
  | { type: "eventPayload"; path: string; op: Comparator; value: unknown }
  | { type: "and"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "or"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "not"; condition: Condition }
  | { type: "custom"; check: string };

type Comparator = "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte";
type PlayerRef =
  | "self"
  | "opponent"
  | "turnPlayer"
  | "nonTurnPlayer"
  | "owner"
  | "controller";
```

`leaderColorCount` is a public Leader metadata condition. It reads only the
player's Leader colors from the match manifest or resolved card snapshot, uses a
canonical `PlayerRef` and `Comparator`, and its `value` is a non-negative safe
integer. Printed "multicolored" Leader conditions map to
`{ type: "leaderColorCount", player: "self", op: "gte", value: 2 }`.

Leader type and Leader attribute conditions do not introduce `leaderType` or
`leaderAttribute` predicates. Represent them through the public Leader Area with
`hasCardInZone` and `CardFilter`, for example
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], typesAny: ["Straw Hat Crew"] } }`
or
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], attributesAny: ["slash"] } }`.
The schema-supported fixture subset admits only this public Leader-zone metadata
form and does not authorize private-zone metadata queries.

Condition, duration, and restriction primitives outside the schema-supported fixture subset remain planned layers. They are contract-defined by this reference, but they are not fixture-authorable until the schema coverage policy lists them as supported.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s011 (Durations)

```ts
type Duration =
  | { type: "thisAction" }
  | { type: "thisBattle" }
  | { type: "thisTurn" }
  | {
      type: "untilEndOfTurn";
      whoseTurn?: "current" | "sourceController" | "targetController";
    }
  | { type: "untilStartOfNextTurn"; player: PlayerRef }
  | { type: "whileSourceOnField" }
  | { type: "whileConditionTrue"; condition: Condition }
  | { type: "permanent" };
```

Use `permanent` sparingly. Field buffs should normally be `whileSourceOnField` or a timing duration.
Duration primitives not listed in the schema-supported fixture subset are contract-defined planned layers until schema coverage, validation fixtures, and runtime capability evidence are added.

```

Cardinality fields such as `min` and `max` use the exact-N and up-to-N semantics from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`. `drawUpTo` is a planned `chooseQuantity`-backed primitive: it must pause through a `chooseQuantity` pending decision, validate the selected whole integer against public min/max bounds, and draw only the chosen amount when a future runtime story makes it executable.

`drawUpTo` short-deck resolution is do-as-much-as-possible. If the chosen quantity is greater than the number of cards remaining in that player's deck, the runtime must draw every remaining card and emit draw and card-movement events only for cards actually drawn. The next rule-processing checkpoint detects deck-out under `02-engine-mechanics.s035`; the effect does not fail closed before drawing the remaining cards solely because the chosen quantity exceeded the remaining deck size.

Event `seq` values for partial-deck drawUpTo resolution must remain strictly increasing by append order, as required by `03-game-state-events-decisions.s005`. The resolved decision increments `state.seq` once under `03-game-state-events-decisions.s022`; individual draw events do not each advance `state.seq`. State hashes at the replay checkpoints include the post-draw empty deck. Golden replay coverage for drawUpTo short-deck cases must pin the final state hash.

Duration and restriction effects such as `cannotAttack`, `cannotBlock`, `cannotBeAttacked`, `cannotBeBlockedBy`, `invalidateEffects`, and `protectFromKO` remain planned unless the schema coverage policy lists them as schema-supported and the runtime capability matrix proves the active engine can enforce the restriction for the full duration.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s013 (Sequence connector semantics)

`Effect.type = "sequence"` uses explicit segment connectors. This avoids ambiguity in card text such as "Then", "If you do", and "If possible".

```ts
interface SequencedEffect {
  id?: string;
  effect: Effect;
  connector:
    | "always"
    | "then"
    | "ifPreviousSucceeded"
    | "ifYouDo"
    | "ifPossible";
  saveResultAs?: string;
}
```

Connector behavior:

| Connector             | Runtime behavior                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `always`              | Run this segment regardless of the previous segment result.                                                                          |
| `then`                | Run after the previous segment; if the previous segment was impossible, continue only when card text says to do as much as possible. |
| `ifPreviousSucceeded` | Run only if the previous segment changed game state or made a legal selection.                                                       |
| `ifYouDo`             | Run only if the player chose/performed the previous optional instruction.                                                            |
| `ifPossible`          | Attempt the segment if there is a legal way to perform it; no error if there is not.                                                 |

A segment result must record at least:

```text
attempted
succeeded
changedState
selectedCards
selectedTargets
paidCost
playerDeclined
```

Those fields drive later connector decisions and replay determinism. Runtime frame, pause/resume, saved-reference, and failure-policy behavior for composed execution is authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s010`, `04-effect-runtime.s012`, and `04-effect-runtime.s016`.

Saved references include `saveResultAs`, `SelectionSetId`, and `SelectionId`. A saved reference is contract-defined here, but generated support may rely on it only when schema validation, parser certification, and runtime capability evidence all cover the reference lifetime, visibility, and later-use legality.

A saved field-object reference is a same-frame saved-reference family for later text such as "that Character". The supported field-object families are `selectedTargets` and `producedObjects`; `selectedCards`, `paidCost`, `SelectionSetId`, `SelectionId`, and saved hand-selection references are separate families and are not field-object target references. A segment with `saveResultAs` may expose `selectedTargets` when it legally selected field objects through a target request, and may expose `producedObjects` when a supported runtime story later creates or moves a public field object and records that object as produced by the segment.

A later segment consumes a saved field-object reference with `{ type: "savedFieldObject", binding: { family: "selectedTargets" | "producedObjects", saveResultAs, objectIndex?, sourceSegmentId? }, zone, player, controller?, filter?, visibility: "publicOnly", onFailure: "failClosed" }`. The reference is valid only inside the same effect execution frame, only for the named `saveResultAs` ledger entry, and only while the referenced object remains a public legal object for the later instruction. unsupported saved-reference families fail closed. stale objects, gone objects, hidden objects, and illegal objects fail closed. Public events, public legal actions, PlayerView, and SpectatorView must not reveal hidden identities or the private saved-reference failure reason. State hashes include the frame saved-reference ledger and the failed segment result so replay, event order, and connector decisions remain deterministic.

Optionality must preserve optional activation, optional cost, and optional effect clause distinctions. These boundaries are part of generated-support capability evidence because a parser that recognizes optional text still cannot make the effect playable unless the runtime can resume and record the correct optional segment result.

Optional cost clauses inside composed sequence execution use a sequence segment
whose effect is `{ type: "payCost"; cost: OptionalCost }`. The optionality flag
lives on the nested `OptionalCost`; `SequencedEffect.optional` remains reserved
for optional effect clauses and must not be used to represent optional cost
decline. Runtime decline for that segment uses the `PayCostDecision` and
`PaymentDeclinedResponse` contract from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s012`
and `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`.
Optional cost decline uses the active `PayCostDecision` and a
`PaymentDeclinedResponse` payload.

`ifYouDo` after an optional cost runs only when the previous cost segment
recorded `paidCost: true`. A declined or failed optional cost segment does not
run dependent `ifYouDo` segments. Segment-result, event-order, state-hash, and
once-per-turn timing for optional cost accept, decline, and failure are
authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s011` and `04-effect-runtime.s012`.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s016 (Replacement triggers)

```ts
type ReplacementTrigger =
  | { type: "wouldBeKOd"; target: Target }
  | { type: "wouldTakeDamage"; target: Target }
  | { type: "wouldBeTrashed"; target: Target }
  | { type: "wouldDraw"; player: PlayerRef }
  | { type: "wouldMoveZone"; from?: Zone; to?: Zone; target: Target }
  | { type: "custom"; event: string };
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s022 (Poneglyph text-to-DSL pipeline)

The effect-system plan supports three authoring paths:

1. Manual DSL definitions written by developers.
2. Custom TypeScript handlers for cards that cannot be expressed in DSL.
3. Generated DSL from Poneglyph printed card text when certified parser rules produce a complete parse and runtime capability checks pass.

Support ladder:

1. `contract-defined`: a primitive or behavior is described by the Markdown spec or canonical TypeScript contract.
2. `schema-authorable`: `contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` can validate JSON fixtures for that primitive.
3. `runtime-executable`: the current runtime capability matrix proves the engine can execute the primitive, including decisions, visibility, replay, failure policy, and pause/resume behavior.
4. `parser-certified`: reviewed parser rules produce a complete parse for the relevant printed text shape.
5. `generated-support playable`: a generated support record may enable normal play only when the parse is complete and every parsed component has current runtime capability evidence.

Schema authorability alone is insufficient for generated-support playable status. Generated support requires runtime capability evidence and complete parser support; schema validation only proves a JSON shape can be authored.

Generated definitions must never be deployed blindly. A new parser rule, ambiguous parse class, custom handler binding, or wording/ruling ambiguity requires review before it can certify support. Once a parser rule is certified, matching complete-parse cards may be generated without a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map for that common template.

A complete parse covers all gameplay-relevant printed text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement or optionality semantics, and ruling/errata inputs that affect behavior. Multiple parsed effects compose into one generated `EffectDefinition`. Partial parse output may be reported for coverage progress, but it must not make the card playable in normal modes.

Bandai or Poneglyph wording drift must invalidate the affected parse/hash evidence or downgrade support until parser and support evidence are updated. If any parsed component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing runtime capability evidence, the generated definition fails closed instead of partially enabling the card.

```ts
interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  source: "poneglyph";
  sourceTextHash: string;
  generatedBy?: "manual" | "rule-parser" | "llm-assisted";
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewedAt?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s029 (Schema coverage policy)

`contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` is the executable JSON fixture contract.
TypeScript/spec primitives outside that JSON schema are planned/not
fixture-authorable until schema validation and fixtures exist.
This list is the fixture-authorability boundary, not generated playable support.
Schema authorability alone does not imply runtime-executable,
parser-certified, or generated-support playable status. New TYP schema stories
may move primitives into the schema-supported fixture subset only when they also
add schema coverage and validation fixtures; generated playable support still
requires complete parser support and runtime capability evidence.

Schema-supported fixture subset:

- trigger: onPlay
- trigger: whenAttacking
- trigger: onOpponentAttack
- trigger: onBlock
- trigger: onKO
- trigger: endOfYourTurn
- trigger: endOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: trigger
- trigger: activateMain
- trigger: main
- trigger: counter
- trigger: permanent
- trigger: startOfGame
- trigger: startOfYourTurn

- trigger: startOfMainPhase
- trigger: endOfBattle
- trigger: donAttach
- trigger: custom

- condition: trashCount (public `player` + `op` + non-negative safe-integer `value`; optional public filter)
- cost: restDon
- cost: returnDon
- cost: restSelf
- cost: sequence
- target: self, myLeader, opponentLeader, attacker, attackTarget, blocker,
  triggerCard, all, choose, savedFieldObject
- duration: thisAction
- duration: thisBattle
- duration: thisTurn
- duration: untilEndOfTurn
- duration: untilStartOfNextTurn
- duration: whileSourceOnField
- duration: permanent

- effect: payCost
- effect: selectCards
- effect: selectTargets
- effect: playSelected
- effect: sequence
- effect: cannotAttack
- effect: cannotBlock
- effect: giveKeyword
- effect: giveProtection (structured `Protection` metadata only; includes TYP-012A field-removal metadata shape)
- effect: custom
- card filters: cardIds, names, nameContains, nameNot, categories, colorsAny,
  colorsAll, typesAny, typesAll, attributesAny, attributesAll, cost, power,
  counter, hasKeywords, lacksKeywords, state, owner, controller, excludeSelf,
  custom

Planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage exists:

- condition: donCount
- condition: opponentTurn
- condition: lifeCount
- condition: handCount
- condition: hasCardInZone
- condition: attackTarget
- condition: cardState
- condition: sourceStillInZone
- condition: eventPayload

- cost: custom
- duration: whileConditionTrue
- effect: search
- effect: lookAtTop
- effect: revealFromZone
- effect: revealTop
- effect: selectFromSet
- effect: moveSelected with position
- effect: putRemaining
- effect: shuffleDeck
- effect: bounce
- effect: trash
- effect: play
- effect: returnUnselectedToDeck
- effect: trashFromHand
- effect: setPowerToZero
- effect: setBasePower
- effect: modifyCost
- effect: setBaseCost
- effect: rest
- effect: activate
- effect: removeKeyword
- effect: addDon
- effect: attachDon
- effect: returnDon
- effect: addLife
- effect: damage
- effect: invalidateEffects
- effect: protectFromKO
- effect: cannotBeAttacked
- effect: cannotBeBlockedBy
- effect: choice
- effect: conditional
- effect: forEachMatch
- effect: repeat
- effect: replacement

new fixture-authorable primitives must add schema coverage and validation fixtures in the same story that makes the primitive authorable.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 11-testing-quality.s020 (Poneglyph/card-data tests)

Add card-data tests once `@optcg/cards` exists:

```text
CD-001 Poneglyph response validates against Zod schema
CD-002 invalid Poneglyph shape fails before Redis cache write
CD-003 Redis cache key includes cardDataVersion and overlay/effect version
CD-004 overlay merge adds support status and effect definition IDs
CD-005 Poneglyph source text hash drift marks implementation stale
CD-006 unsupported non-vanilla Poneglyph card cannot enter ranked deck
CD-007 variant indexes/generated variant keys are accepted only when valid for the base card
CD-008 client display data cannot alter server-resolved match manifest
CD-009 generated support index accepts only complete-parse cards whose every parsed component is covered by the runtime capability matrix
CD-010 partial, ambiguous, stale, unparsed, unsupported, or capability-missing generated support reports do not make cards playable in normal modes
CD-011 certified parser-rule fixtures auto-support matching complete-parse common-template cards without a manual per-card allowlist
```

These tests prevent the card-data layer from becoming an implicit rules authority.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only shared Effect DSL contract, schema, fixture, and spec-authorability updates for public trash-count conditions, continuous keyword grants, and field-removal protection grants. Do not implement engine materialization, runtime capability evidence, card parser/generated-support promotion, support manifests, source hashes, behavior hashes, overlays, or real-card fixture support.

## Scope

- authorize the Effect DSL schema and exported contract types for public `trashCount` conditions using `player`, `op`, and non-negative safe-integer `value`
- authorize the Effect DSL schema and exported contract types for continuous keyword grants using a reusable target, keyword token, and duration shape
- add a reusable Effect DSL protection-grant primitive, such as `giveProtection`, that carries the existing TYP-012A `Protection` metadata, target, and duration without using a string template or card-specific branch
- authorize a schema-valid permanent continuous effect block that combines a public condition with a sequence of continuous keyword-grant and field-removal protection-grant effects
- use the existing TYP-012A field-removal protection metadata axes for opponent-controlled card-effect field removal, target scope `thisCard`, and explicit battle/rule/cost/controller-owned/custom exclusions
- update the Effect DSL fixture-authorability policy so the newly authorable primitives move out of the planned-only list with narrow wording
- add positive and negative schema/type fixtures proving the reusable primitive shapes, composition shape, and malformed protection metadata boundaries
- preserve the distinction that schema/type authorability is not engine runtime support, runtime capability evidence, parser certification, generated-support playability, or real-card support

## Out of Scope

- engine runtime behavior or materializing permanent/continuous Effect DSL blocks into `ContinuousEffectRecord`s
- runtime capability matrix updates
- card parser rules, card-layer generated support, support-probe/report promotion, support manifests, cards-produced manifests, overlays, source hashes, behavior hashes, or real-card fixture capture
- exact full-card text branches, exact full-effect sentence branches, one real card, or a human-held adjacent-card list
- new protection families beyond TYP-012A opponent-effect field-removal metadata
- hidden/private conditions, private-zone predicates, arbitrary condition query language, or unsupported field-removal process classifications
- server, client, API, UI, database, replay UI, WebSocket, Redis, or live Poneglyph work

- agent-packets/TYP-012B.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- generate and activate the TYP-012B packet before implementation
- stay within allowed touch points
- keep the patch contract/schema focused and do not add engine-core runtime behavior
- do not update `packages/cards` runtime capability matrix or generated-support admission in this story
- fail closed if the protection-grant primitive cannot be represented with structured TYP-012A metadata
- fail closed if the proposed composition would require card-specific text authority or broad natural-language inference
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- story-review for TYP-012B before approval handoff
- positive schema fixture for a permanent continuous block with `trashCount` condition, `giveKeyword`, and field-removal `giveProtection`
- positive type tests for the new protection-grant effect contract and the reusable conditional continuous composition shape
- negative schema fixtures for malformed protection metadata, unsupported protection family, malformed trash-count condition, malformed keyword grant, and unsupported composition shapes
- contract-layer guard test or fixture assertion proving schema-valid DSL remains authorability-only and does not claim runtime capability, parser certification, generated support, or card playability
- run `corepack pnpm exec tsc -p packages/types/tsconfig.json --noEmit`
- run `corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/types/src/effects.test.ts packages/types/src/runtime.test.ts packages/types/src/export-cohesion.test.ts`
- run `corepack pnpm run types:sync:check`
- run `corepack pnpm run contracts:validate-effects`
- run `corepack pnpm run test:contracts`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- schema/type fixtures can represent a permanent continuous effect block gated by `trashCount` and containing both a continuous keyword grant and a field-removal protection grant
- the protection-grant primitive uses structured TYP-012A `Protection` metadata instead of text, card IDs, or full-sentence templates
- malformed protection metadata, unsupported protection families, malformed condition values, and unsupported composition shapes reject through contract/schema validation
- the updated Effect DSL reference clearly marks only the newly covered primitives as fixture-authorable and keeps still-unsupported nearby primitives planned-only
- tests or fixtures prove schema-valid authorability does not imply runtime capability evidence, parser certification, generated-support status, or card playability
- downstream ENG and CARD stories can cite this story as the missing contract/schema prerequisite without changing contracts again for this protection/keyword/condition composition shape
