## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s006 (Event visibility)

Events may contain hidden data. Filter them before sending to clients.

```ts
type EventVisibility =
  | { type: "public" }
  | { type: "private"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "hidden" }
  | { type: "replayOnly" };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s013 (Targets/cards)

```ts
interface SelectTargetsDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "selectTargets";
  request: TargetRequest;
  candidates: TargetCandidate[];
}

interface SelectCardsDecision extends BaseDecision {
  type: "selectCards";
  request: CardSelectionRequest;
  candidates: CardSelectionCandidate[];
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s015 (Legal actions)

`getLegalActions()` should return actions valid for the current game state and current pending decision.

```ts
function getLegalActions(state: GameState, playerId: PlayerId): LegalAction[] {
  if (state.pendingDecision) {
    return legalResponsesForDecision(state.pendingDecision, playerId, state);
  }

  return legalPhaseActions(state, playerId);
}
```

Legal actions sent to a client must not leak hidden information. For example, the opponent should not receive an action list that implies exactly which hidden counter cards exist.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s018 (Canonical event visibility)

Each `EngineEvent` has one visibility policy:

```text
public          safe for both players immediately
private         visible only to listed player IDs
replayOnly      hidden during live play but available in completed full replay
serverOnly      never leaves trusted server/runtime logs
```

Visibility is independent of replay determinism. Replay artifacts may store information that was never sent to either player during the live match.

### 04-effect-runtime.s017 (Transient reveal and selection sets)

Transient sets are part of effect execution context, not normal zones. They exist for patterns such as revealing the top card, selecting from a revealed set, and returning unselected cards face-down.

Rules:

1. A transient set has an origin, visibility, and cleanup policy.
2. Cards in a transient set are not simultaneously in hand/deck/trash/life.
3. Movement from a transient set to a real zone must emit a `cardMoved` event with appropriate visibility.
4. If an effect exits early, cleanup policy runs before the queue continues.
5. Opponent views may see a revealed card only for the duration and visibility specified by the effect. If the card returns face-down to a hidden zone, future opponent views must not retain its ID.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s014 (Search request)

```ts
interface SearchRequest {
  zone: "deck" | "trash" | "life";
  player: PlayerRef;
  lookCount?: number;
  filter: CardFilter;
  min: number;
  max: number;
  destination: Zone;
  revealTo: Visibility;
  remainingCards?: {
    destination: Zone;
    position: "top" | "bottom";
    order: "ownerChoice" | "random";
  };
  shuffleAfter?: boolean;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s015 (Visibility)

```ts
type Visibility =
  | "bothPlayers"
  | "chooserOnly"
  | "ownerOnly"
  | "controllerOnly"
  | "hidden"
  | "replayOnly";
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s026 (Transient reveal and selection primitives)

```ts
type SelectionSetId = string;
type SelectionId = string;

type Effect =
  | {
      type: "revealTop";
      player: PlayerRef;
      count: number;
      saveAs: SelectionSetId;
      visibility: Visibility;
    }
  | {
      type: "selectFromSet";
      set: SelectionSetId;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
      min: number;
      max: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      saveAs: SelectionId;
    }
  | {
      type: "selectCards";
      zone: Zone;
      player: PlayerRef;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
      min: number;
      max: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      saveAs: SelectionId;
      visibility: Visibility;
    }
  | {
      type: "playSelected";
      selection: SelectionId;
      enterRested?: boolean;
      ignoreCost?: boolean;
    }
  | {
      type: "returnUnselectedToDeck";
      set: SelectionSetId;
      player: PlayerRef;
      position: "top" | "bottom";
      order: "original" | "ownerChoice" | "random";
      faceDown: boolean;
    }
  | {
      type: "moveSelected";
      selection: SelectionId;
      from: Zone | SelectionSetId;
      to: Zone;
    };
```

These are not UI concepts. They are deterministic effect-runtime concepts. They let the runtime represent "reveal top card, maybe play it, otherwise return it face-down" without losing hidden-information boundaries.

### 06-visibility-security.s003 (Player zone visibility)

| Zone           | Self view                        | Opponent view                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Deck           | Count only                       | Count only                       |
| DON!! Deck     | Count only / cosmetic art policy | Count only / cosmetic art policy |
| Hand           | Full card data                   | Count only                       |
| Trash          | Full ordered public data         | Full ordered public data         |
| Leader Area    | Full public data                 | Full public data                 |
| Character Area | Full public data                 | Full public data                 |
| Stage Area     | Full public data                 | Full public data                 |
| Cost Area      | Full public DON!! state          | Full public DON!! state          |
| Life Area      | Count + face-up cards only       | Count + face-up cards only       |
| No Zone        | Only if revealed to that player  | Only if revealed to that player  |

### 06-visibility-security.s004 (PlayerView shape)

```ts
interface PlayerView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  self: VisiblePlayerState;
  opponent: OpponentVisibleState;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PublicDecision;
  legalActions: PublicLegalAction[];
  revealedCards: PublicRevealRecord[];
  events: EngineEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Do not include:

- Deck order.
- Opponent hand card IDs.
- Face-down life card IDs.
- RNG seed/internal state.
- Effect queue internals.
- Private decision candidates not visible to recipient.
- Internal crash/recovery metadata.

Canonical public support DTOs for the initial live view contract:

```ts
type SpectatorPolicy = {
  mode: "disabled" | "live-filtered";
  allowHandRevealAfterGame: boolean;
};

interface PublicTurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}

interface PublicBattleState {
  attacker: CardRef;
  originalTarget: CardRef;
  currentTarget: CardRef;
  blocker?: CardRef;
  step: BattleStep;
  damageCount: number;
}

interface PublicCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  attachedDonCount: number;
  turnPlayed?: number;
}

interface PublicLifeView {
  count: number;
  faceUpCards: PublicCardView[];
}

interface VisiblePlayerState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  hand: PublicCardView[];
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

interface OpponentVisibleState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  handCount: number;
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

type SpectatorVisiblePlayerState = OpponentVisibleState;

interface PublicDecision {
  id: DecisionId;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

type PublicLegalAction =
  | { type: "playCard"; card: CardRef; costPaymentRequired?: boolean }
  | { type: "activateEffect"; source: CardRef; effectId: EffectId }
  | { type: "attachDon"; don: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; card: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "respondToDecision"; decisionId: DecisionId };

interface PublicRevealRecord {
  id: string;
  cards: CardRef[];
  visibility: "public" | "privateToRecipient";
  origin: ZoneRef | "topOfDeck" | "lifeDamage" | "custom";
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  cleanupPolicy: "returnToOrigin" | "trashAfterResolution" | "none";
}

type SpectatorRevealRecord = Omit<PublicRevealRecord, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: "public";
};

type SpectatorEvent = Omit<EngineEvent, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: { type: "public" };
};
```

Initial live-filtered spectator view is distinct from `PlayerView`:

```ts
interface SpectatorView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  spectatorPolicy: SpectatorPolicy;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, SpectatorVisiblePlayerState>;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  revealedCards: SpectatorRevealRecord[];
  events: SpectatorEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Initial `SpectatorView` has no `pendingDecision` or `legalActions` field.
It does not include either player's hand card IDs, deck order, face-down life
card IDs, private reveal records, non-public events, RNG state, effect queue
internals, or audit entries. Full-information live spectating is deferred to a
future explicit policy story.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only reveal event emission and decision creation for the supported transient set path. The chooser is the controller. Create only a `selectCards` pending decision with `min: 0`, `max: 1`, chooser-only visibility, and candidates restricted to matching cards from the active transient set. If ENG-047A produced no transient set because the top card was absent or ineligible, create no decision and reveal no card identity. Do not resolve decisions, move cards, or add broad choice grammar in this story.

## Scope

- create a deterministic chooser-private reveal event for the supported transient set path
- create one pending `selectCards` decision for the controller when an eligible top-card candidate exists
- include only matching transient-set candidate identifiers in the decision payload visible to that chooser
- create no decision and reveal no card identity when no eligible candidate exists
- avoid exposing chooser-only candidate details to the opponent
- fail closed for unsupported candidate counts or malformed transient set state

## Out of Scope

- decision response application
- moving selected cards
- cleanup after completion
- real-card fixtures or UI display

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/types/src/decisions.ts
- packages/types/src/decisions.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime*.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/action-dispatcher*.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/search-reveal*.test.ts

- stories/approved/ENG-047B-reveal-choice-decision-creation.yaml
- agent-packets/ENG-047B.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-047B packet while implementing this story
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-047 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- focused reveal decision creation tests
- hidden-info regression for decision candidate visibility
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck`
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`
- run `corepack pnpm run verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- supported eligible top-card path emits deterministic chooser-private reveal and decision-created events
- pending choice decision belongs to the correct player
- private candidate details are visible only to the chooser
- no-eligible top-card path creates no decision and leaks no card identity
- malformed or unsupported transient set state rejects without mutation

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
