## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 11-testing-quality.s002 (Testing goals)

The engine must be testable without UI, network, Redis, or Postgres. Most correctness bugs should be caught in package-level tests before an integration test or manual playtest.

### 11-testing-quality.s007 (Interaction tests)

Representative interactions:

```text
tests/interactions/
  blocker-plus-unblockable.test.ts
  double-attack-plus-banish.test.ts
  replacement-on-ko.test.ts
  simultaneous-ko-triggers.test.ts
  on-ko-source-presence.test.ts
  trigger-during-damage-defers.test.ts
  event-activates-effect-after-resolution.test.ts
  negative-power-stays-on-field.test.ts
  negative-cost-clamps-to-zero.test.ts
```

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Each package must expose consistent task names where applicable:

- `build`
- `typecheck`
- `lint`
- `test`
- `test:watch`
- `coverage`

Integration-heavy packages may additionally expose:

- `test:integration`
- `test:replay`
- `test:contracts`
- `test:hidden-info`

At the root, the workspace must provide:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm coverage
pnpm verify
```

`pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command and must run the same core checks as the main merge CI pipeline.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

A pull request must not merge unless the main CI pipeline passes.

Minimum required merge gates:

1. install dependencies with locked versions,
2. build/typecheck workspace,
3. lint workspace,
4. run tests,
5. validate contracts and schemas,
6. validate formatting,
7. publish coverage artifact,
8. fail if generated artifacts or snapshots are stale when the repo defines them.

Recommended CI jobs:

- `quality` -> lint, typecheck, format check
- `engine` -> engine unit, interaction, invariant, replay tests
- `contracts` -> canonical types, DSL schema, fixture normalization, SQL/schema validation
- `client-server-smoke` -> protocol smoke tests and filtered-view checks

For protected branches, require at least one human review plus passing CI.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only test relocation and minimal shared test-helper extraction for battle action coverage. Do not modify production battle implementation in this story.

## Scope

- move declare-attack, Rush, and combat-body legality tests into a focused declare-attack suite
- move vanilla damage, Character K.O., Banish, life movement, and cleanup helper tests into focused damage or cleanup suites
- move Character Counter and Counter Step tests into a focused counter suite
- move Blocker and Block Step tests into a focused blocker suite
- extract only shared test helpers needed to avoid duplication across the split suites
- preserve existing test assertions, coverage intent, and fixture behavior

## Out of Scope

- production source changes
- new behavior tests for rules not already covered
- changing public APIs, action payloads, event payloads, hidden-info behavior, state hashing, or fail-closed semantics

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

- packages/engine-core/src/battle-declare-attack.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-damage-banish.test.ts

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-022A packet while implementing this story
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify before implementation and review handoff
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-022 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- if implementation requires production changes, stop and split or record the blocker
- implementation-review gate is required after the PR is opened
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-declare-attack.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-damage-banish.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-counter.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-blocker.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-cleanup.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/event-sequencing-regression.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- battle-actions.test.ts is materially reduced by moving cohesive groups into focused test files
- moved tests still exercise the same production APIs and assertions
- no production files are changed
- focused battle test command and full verify pass

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
