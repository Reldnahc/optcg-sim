## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseQuantity
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

For `chooseQuantity`, the response payload shape is `{ type: "chooseQuantity"; quantity: number }`. The outer `respondToDecision.decisionId` must name the active `chooseQuantity` decision. The inner `ChooseQuantityResponse` payload does not carry a decision ID; it is valid only when it has response type `chooseQuantity` and carries a whole integer `quantity` inside the decision's allowed `min` and `max` bounds.

Cardinality is explicit:

- exact-N decisions use `mode: "exact"` and must be represented with `min: N` and `max: N`; `mode: "exact"` with different `min` and `max` values is malformed and must not be created. A response below the required value, above it, non-integer, negative when the minimum is non-negative, or otherwise out-of-range is an `invalidDecisionResponse`.
- up-to-N decisions use `mode: "upTo"` and allow a partial response from `min` through `max`, inclusive. Choosing `max` is legal. Choosing less than `max` is legal only when it is still at least `min`.
- zero is legal only when the decision's `min` is `0`; exact-0 is represented as `min: 0`, `max: 0`, and `mode: "exact"`.
- minimum and maximum bounds are authoritative. Responses below `min`, above `max`, non-integer, missing, or with the wrong response type are rejected as `invalidDecisionResponse`.

Quantity decisions exposed through legal actions must advertise only public bounds, prompt text, and the active decision ID. They must not reveal hidden candidate counts, must not reveal hidden card identities, and must not encode whether a private candidate set contains a particular card. If a quantity is constrained by hidden information, the engine validates against the private candidate set internally and returns `invalidDecisionResponse` for illegal responses without disclosing the hidden reason through public legal actions or public events.

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s022 (Internal state sequencing)

```ts
type StateSeq = number & { __brand: "StateSeq" };

interface TurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}
```

Increment `state.seq` after every accepted action or resolved decision, not after every internal event. Internal events have their own sequence inside the event journal.

### 04-effect-runtime.s002 (Overview)

The effect runtime executes effect definitions against the authoritative game state.

```text
Effect definitions        Runtime                 Engine core
DSL + custom handlers --> queue/choices/events --> atomic state mutations
```

The runtime must preserve timing, hidden information, source-presence rules, replacement effects, and deterministic replay.

**v6 contract:** queue entries, decisions, replacement state, and continuous-effect records are defined in [`contracts/canonical-types.ts`](contracts/canonical-types.ts). The algorithms below are normative when they are more precise than older snippets.

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

Generic composed execution is represented by a resumable effect execution frame stored in `GameState.effectExecutionFrames`. The frame is serialized authoritative runtime context for one resolving effect and is not a client-facing object. It must track at least the queue entry, effect block, current effect path, next segment index, saved result references, segment results, transient selection sets, and pending-decision continuation. Frame records participate in authoritative canonical serialization and state hashes, but filtered player and live spectator views must not expose frame internals.

When a sequence segment pauses for a `PendingDecision`, the runtime stores the frame and returns the pending decision with the same causality context. After a valid response, resolution resumes from the stored frame at the paused segment rather than restarting earlier segments. Completed earlier segments must not be re-applied, and their saved result references and segment results remain available for later connector decisions.

### 04-effect-runtime.s012 (Player choices during effect resolution)

Effects pause through `PendingDecision`.

Example target selection flow:

```ts
function executeKoEffect(
  state: GameState,
  effect: KoEffect,
  context: EffectContext,
): EngineResult {
  const candidates = resolveTargetCandidates(state, effect.target, context);

  if (requiresChoice(effect.target)) {
    return pauseForDecision(state, {
      type: "selectTargets",
      playerId: resolveChooser(effect.target, context),
      request: effect.target,
      candidates,
      causedBy: context.causedBy,
    });
  }

  return koTargets(state, candidates.selected, context);
}
```

Decision responses are validated by the engine, not the client.

Composed execution records one segment result for every attempted sequence segment or optional clause. A segment result must record `attempted`, `succeeded`, `changedState`, `selectedCards`, `selectedTargets`, `paidCost`, and `playerDeclined`. `succeeded` means the segment legally performed its required instruction, while `changedState` separately records whether canonical state changed. Legal selection without mutation may still drive connectors such as "if you do" when card text depends on choosing or identifying an object.

Saved-result references may bind selected cards, selected targets, paid costs, or produced objects for later text such as `that Character`. A later segment may use a saved-result reference only while the referenced object remains legal for that later instruction; otherwise the later segment follows its connector and failure policy. Saved references must preserve hidden-information visibility and replay determinism.

### 04-effect-runtime.s016 (Failure policy)

```ts
type FailurePolicy =
  | "doAsMuchAsPossible"
  | "requiresAll"
  | "skipIfNoLegalTarget"
  | "optionalIfPossible";
```

Default is `doAsMuchAsPossible`, unless a connector or card text requires dependency.

For composed execution, failure policy applies to the whole effect block and to each segment through its connector:

- `doAsMuchAsPossible` attempts each supported segment and records per-segment success without rolling back successful independent segments.
- `requiresAll` fails the composed execution before mutation when any required segment cannot legally complete.
- `skipIfNoLegalTarget` skips the composed execution when required activation-time or first required resolution-time targets are absent.
- `optionalIfPossible` offers the optional instruction only when at least one legal execution path exists; if none exists, the segment is not attempted and does not create a decision.

Unsupported composed runtime shapes default to fail-closed rather than degrading to partial execution. Ambiguous connector dependency, saved-reference lifetime, optionality boundary, target visibility, pending-decision continuation, or replacement interaction must be treated as unsupported until the spec and capability matrix authorize it.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s013 (Sequence connector semantics)

`Effect.type = "sequence"` uses explicit segment connectors. This avoids ambiguity in card text such as "Then", "If you do", and "If possible".

```ts
interface SequencedEffect {
  id?: string;
  effect: Effect;
  connector:
    | "always"
    | "then"
    | "ifPreviousSucceeded"
    | "ifYouDo"
    | "ifPossible";
  saveResultAs?: string;
}
```

Connector behavior:

| Connector             | Runtime behavior                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `always`              | Run this segment regardless of the previous segment result.                                                                          |
| `then`                | Run after the previous segment; if the previous segment was impossible, continue only when card text says to do as much as possible. |
| `ifPreviousSucceeded` | Run only if the previous segment changed game state or made a legal selection.                                                       |
| `ifYouDo`             | Run only if the player chose/performed the previous optional instruction.                                                            |
| `ifPossible`          | Attempt the segment if there is a legal way to perform it; no error if there is not.                                                 |

A segment result must record at least:

```text
attempted
succeeded
changedState
selectedCards
selectedTargets
paidCost
playerDeclined
```

Those fields drive later connector decisions and replay determinism. Runtime frame, pause/resume, saved-reference, and failure-policy behavior for composed execution is authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s010`, `04-effect-runtime.s012`, and `04-effect-runtime.s016`.

Saved references include `saveResultAs`, `SelectionSetId`, and `SelectionId`. A saved reference is contract-defined here, but generated support may rely on it only when schema validation, parser certification, and runtime capability evidence all cover the reference lifetime, visibility, and later-use legality.

Optionality must preserve optional activation, optional cost, and optional effect clause distinctions. These boundaries are part of generated-support capability evidence because a parser that recognizes optional text still cannot make the effect playable unless the runtime can resume and record the correct optional segment result.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 22-v6-implementation-tightening.s007 (3. DSL schema)

The canonical schema is `contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json`.

Key decisions:

- `CardFilter.costOp` and `CardFilter.costValue` are deprecated.
- Use `CardFilter.cost: { op, value }` or `CardFilter.cost: { min, max }`.
- `CardFilter.type`, `typeIncludes`, and `typeIncludesAny` are merged into `typesAny` and `typesAll`.
- `CardFilter.color` and `colorIncludes` are merged into `colorsAny` and `colorsAll`.
- `CardFilter.attribute` is merged into `attributesAny` and `attributesAll`.
- `moveSelected` has one signature: `{ type: "moveSelected", selection, from, to, position? }`.
- Transient reveal/selection primitives are canonical runtime concepts, not UI concepts.
- `sequence.effects[]` uses explicit connector semantics.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only generic effect execution frames, sequence pause/resume mechanics, segment result tracking, and fail-closed unsupported sequence behavior. Do not migrate draw-then-trash or implement specific new primitives in this story.

## Scope

- add execution context/frame stack for resumable composed effect execution
- support sequence pause/resume around pending decisions from the stored frame at the paused segment without re-applying completed earlier segments
- preserve the original queue-entry causality context across pause/resume
- track segment results: attempted, succeeded, changedState, selected cards/targets, paidCost, and playerDeclined
- store and preserve saved-result-reference slots/metadata across pause/resume for later authorized runtime consumers
- preserve transient selection-set state inside execution frames, or fail closed for sequence shapes that require unsupported transient selection-set state
- fail closed when a sequence shape is unsupported
- add event-order, hidden-info, and state-hash regression coverage

## Out of Scope

- migrating existing draw-then-trash behavior
- implementing optionality, costs, playSelected, drawUpTo, saved-reference consumer semantics, or modifiers
- parser/card support
- replacement generalization

## Constraints

- keep the frame model internal to engine-core unless contracts require otherwise
- do not import @optcg/cards
- fail closed on replay or hidden-info ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- synthetic runtime tests for sequence pause/resume
- fail-closed unsupported sequence tests
- replay regression for pause/resume through a stored frame, including stable event order, final state hash, and correct `state.seq` advancement
- hidden-info, event-order, and state-hash tests
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- sequence frames can pause and resume around decisions deterministically
- valid decision responses resume at the paused segment with prior segment results, saved references, transient sets, and causality context intact
- completed earlier sequence segments are not re-applied during resume
- segment result metadata is recorded for later runtime consumers
- saved-result-reference frame metadata is preserved without resolving later consumer semantics
- unsupported sequence shapes fail closed
- no existing supported behavior changes
