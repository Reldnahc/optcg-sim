## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 04-effect-runtime.s012 (Player choices during effect resolution)

Effects pause through `PendingDecision`.

Example target selection flow:

```ts
function executeKoEffect(
  state: GameState,
  effect: KoEffect,
  context: EffectContext,
): EngineResult {
  const candidates = resolveTargetCandidates(state, effect.target, context);

  if (requiresChoice(effect.target)) {
    return pauseForDecision(state, {
      type: "selectTargets",
      playerId: resolveChooser(effect.target, context),
      request: effect.target,
      candidates,
      causedBy: context.causedBy,
    });
  }

  return koTargets(state, candidates.selected, context);
}
```

Decision responses are validated by the engine, not the client.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s008 (Targets)

Use `TargetRequest` when a player may choose and `Target` for source-relative automatic targets.

```ts
type Target =
  | { type: "self" }
  | { type: "myLeader" }
  | { type: "opponentLeader" }
  | { type: "attacker" }
  | { type: "attackTarget" }
  | { type: "blocker" }
  | { type: "triggerCard" }
  | { type: "all"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter?: CardFilter }
  | { type: "choose"; request: TargetRequest };

interface TargetRequest {
  timing: "onActivation" | "onResolution";
  chooser: PlayerRef;
  zone: Zone;
  player: PlayerRef;
  filter?: CardFilter;
  min: number;
  max: number;
  allowFewerIfUnavailable: boolean;
  visibility?: "public" | "privateToChooser";
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s009 (Card filters)

```ts
interface CardFilter {
  cardIds?: CardId[];
  names?: string[];
  nameContains?: string;
  nameNot?: string[];
  categories?: CardCategory[];
  colorsAny?: Color[];
  colorsAll?: Color[];
  typesAny?: string[];
  typesAll?: string[];
  attributesAny?: Attribute[];
  attributesAll?: Attribute[];
  cost?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  power?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  counter?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  hasKeywords?: Keyword[];
  lacksKeywords?: Keyword[];
  state?: "active" | "rested" | "attached";
  owner?: PlayerRef;
  controller?: PlayerRef;
  excludeSelf?: boolean;
  custom?: string;
}
```

### 06-visibility-security.s003 (Player zone visibility)

| Zone           | Self view                        | Opponent view                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Deck           | Count only                       | Count only                       |
| DON!! Deck     | Count only / cosmetic art policy | Count only / cosmetic art policy |
| Hand           | Full card data                   | Count only                       |
| Trash          | Full ordered public data         | Full ordered public data         |
| Leader Area    | Full public data                 | Full public data                 |
| Character Area | Full public data                 | Full public data                 |
| Stage Area     | Full public data                 | Full public data                 |
| Cost Area      | Full public DON!! state          | Full public DON!! state          |
| Life Area      | Count + face-up cards only       | Count + face-up cards only       |
| No Zone        | Only if revealed to that player  | Only if revealed to that player  |

### 06-visibility-security.s004 (PlayerView shape)

```ts
interface PlayerView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  self: VisiblePlayerState;
  opponent: OpponentVisibleState;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PublicDecision;
  legalActions: PublicLegalAction[];
  revealedCards: PublicRevealRecord[];
  events: EngineEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Do not include:

- Deck order.
- Opponent hand card IDs.
- Face-down life card IDs.
- RNG seed/internal state.
- Effect queue internals.
- Private decision candidates not visible to recipient.
- Internal crash/recovery metadata.

Canonical public support DTOs for the initial live view contract:

```ts
type SpectatorPolicy = {
  mode: "disabled" | "live-filtered";
  allowHandRevealAfterGame: boolean;
};

interface PublicTurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}

interface PublicBattleState {
  attacker: CardRef;
  originalTarget: CardRef;
  currentTarget: CardRef;
  blocker?: CardRef;
  step: BattleStep;
  damageCount: number;
}

interface PublicCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  attachedDonCount: number;
  turnPlayed?: number;
}

interface PublicLifeView {
  count: number;
  faceUpCards: PublicCardView[];
}

interface VisiblePlayerState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  hand: PublicCardView[];
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

interface OpponentVisibleState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  handCount: number;
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

type SpectatorVisiblePlayerState = OpponentVisibleState;

interface PublicDecision {
  id: DecisionId;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

type PublicLegalAction =
  | { type: "playCard"; card: CardRef; costPaymentRequired?: boolean }
  | { type: "activateEffect"; source: CardRef; effectId: EffectId }
  | { type: "attachDon"; don: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; card: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "respondToDecision"; decisionId: DecisionId };

interface PublicRevealRecord {
  id: string;
  cards: CardRef[];
  visibility: "public" | "privateToRecipient";
  origin: ZoneRef | "topOfDeck" | "lifeDamage" | "custom";
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  cleanupPolicy: "returnToOrigin" | "trashAfterResolution" | "none";
}

type SpectatorRevealRecord = Omit<PublicRevealRecord, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: "public";
};

type SpectatorEvent = Omit<EngineEvent, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: { type: "public" };
};
```

Initial live-filtered spectator view is distinct from `PlayerView`:

```ts
interface SpectatorView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  spectatorPolicy: SpectatorPolicy;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, SpectatorVisiblePlayerState>;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  revealedCards: SpectatorRevealRecord[];
  events: SpectatorEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Initial `SpectatorView` has no `pendingDecision` or `legalActions` field.
It does not include either player's hand card IDs, deck order, face-down life
card IDs, private reveal records, non-public events, RNG state, effect queue
internals, or audit entries. Full-information live spectating is deferred to a
future explicit policy story.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only target candidate resolution from GameState and fail-closed guards for unsupported or ambiguous target requests. Do not create pending decisions, accept responses, or resolve target effects.

## Scope

- introduce a narrowly named engine helper for resolving target candidates from authoritative GameState
- support only public, currently visible candidate sets from board-like zones needed by existing supported effect tests, such as leader and character zones, when chooser, player, zone, min, max, and filters are unambiguous
- apply supported CardFilter predicates using authoritative card instance and definition data already available to engine-core
- return deterministic candidate ordering for identical GameState inputs
- return a typed fail-closed error for unsupported zones, hidden/private candidate requests, unsupported filters, invalid min/max values, unresolved player refs, or ambiguous visibility
- keep target candidate resolution independent from client display data and submitted action payloads

## Out of Scope

- creating selectTargets pending decisions
- validating selectTargets responses
- resolving KO, trash, rest, modifyPower, or other target effects
- search, look, or reveal transient sets
- privateToChooser candidate exposure
- replacement effects
- optional activation
- custom handlers
- server/client/UI

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/target-selection.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/target-selection.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/action-test-fixtures.ts
- stories/approved/ENG-029A-resolve-target-candidates.yaml
- agent-packets/ENG-029A.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-029A packet while implementing this story
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify before implementation and review handoff
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-029 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- if candidate resolution needs search/look/reveal transient sets, private candidate visibility policy changes, new DSL primitives, or custom handlers, stop and split or record the blocker
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/target-selection.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- supported public board target requests produce deterministic candidate CardRef values from GameState
- filters supported by this story include at least category and power/cost equality or range when those fields are available through existing engine data
- unsupported filters, hidden zones, private candidate visibility, invalid min/max, or unresolved player refs fail closed without mutating state
- candidate ordering and state hash remain stable for identical input states

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer
