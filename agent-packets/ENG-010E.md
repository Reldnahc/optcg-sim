# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-010E
Epic ID: M1-001
Title: Add effect queue choice-bucket grouping
Type: implementation
Area: engine
Primary Concern: rules

## Why

Extend the effect queue helper surface from ENG-010A with pure grouping of validated pending entries by timing window, generation, ordering bucket, and controller so later stories can identify `chooseTriggerOrder` requirements without creating decisions.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s004 (Authority and official-rules defaults)

- Official card wording overrides the comprehensive rules when they conflict.
- Official FAQ/rulings/errata refine behavior when printed text alone is insufficient.
- The simulator must implement that authority through DSL/custom handlers and card-specific tests.
- Simultaneous player choices are ordered turn player first, then non-turn player.
- When both players have triggered effects at the same timing, turn-player effects resolve first under the official timing rules.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until damage processing is complete, except for `[Trigger]` handling which follows the official interrupt path.

### 04-effect-runtime.s006 (Effect queue entry)

```ts
interface EffectQueueEntry {
  id: QueueEntryId;
  state: "pending" | "resolving" | "resolved" | "cancelled";
  timingWindowId: TimingWindowId;
  generation: number;
  controllerId: PlayerId;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  triggerEventId?: EngineEventId;
  effectBlockId: EffectId;
  orderingGroup: "turnPlayer" | "nonTurnPlayer";
  createdAtEventSeq: number;
  queuedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  sourcePresencePolicy: SourcePresencePolicy;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s009 (Queue ordering)

Every trigger collection creates or joins a timing window. Queue order is deterministic and must not depend on JavaScript array discovery order except where the spec explicitly says discovery order is the canonical tie-breaker.

Normative ordering algorithm:

```text
1. Assign every collected trigger a timingWindowId.
2. Assign generation = 0 for effects triggered by the original timing event.
3. When resolving an effect produces new triggers, enqueue them with generation = currentGeneration + 1 in the same timing window unless a new official timing window has opened.
4. Resolve older timing windows before newer timing windows.
5. Within a timing window, resolve lower generation before higher generation.
6. Within a generation, resolve turn-player bucket before non-turn-player bucket.
7. Within a player's bucket, if more than one effect is pending, create chooseTriggerOrder for that player.
8. If no choice is required, use stable tie-breakers: createdAtEventSeq, then source instance id, then effect id.
```

Consequences:

- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are pending, and A creates turn player effect C while resolving, B resolves before C.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage points are complete, except `[Trigger]` resolution itself.
- Effects triggered during an effect or card activation wait until the triggering process completes.
- Optional triggered effects create `chooseOptionalActivation` decisions at the point they would enter or begin resolution, according to the card's timing rule.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s022 (Internal state sequencing)

```ts
type StateSeq = number & { __brand: "StateSeq" };

interface TurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}
```

Increment `state.seq` after every accepted action or resolved decision, not after every internal event. Internal events have their own sequence inside the event journal.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Package-boundary enforcement is required, not optional.

At minimum, lint rules or dependency-cruiser / equivalent boundary tooling must enforce:

- `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.
- `@optcg/view-engine` cannot import hidden-information-only server modules.
- `@optcg/client` cannot import server-only packages.
- `@optcg/server` cannot bypass `@optcg/cards` to call card-data sources directly from engine execution paths.
- test helpers that expose hidden state cannot be imported into browser/client production bundles.
- replay validation code cannot depend on client rendering code.

If stronger tooling is adopted, such as dependency-cruiser, Knip, or custom graph checks, CI must fail on violations.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code.
- The client must not import `engine-core` once hidden state exists; use `view-engine`.
- The card-data package may call Poneglyph, but effect resolution must consume resolved manifests, not live HTTP calls.
- Unsupported cards must fail closed outside dev sandbox.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only pure grouping for already-validated pending effect queue entries. Stop before no-choice ordering, queue processing, trigger detection, source-presence checks, pending decision creation, legal-action gating, or integration into phase, play-card, or battle paths.

## Scope

- add named exports for grouping ENG-010A-validated pending `EffectQueueEntry` values
- group entries by normalized timing-window rank, `generation`, `orderingGroup`, and `controllerId`
- report buckets with more than one pending effect for the same `controllerId` as requiring `chooseTriggerOrder` for that player
- preserve input queue arrays and entries without mutation
- keep helpers independent from `GameState` mutation, event creation, pending decision creation, rule processing, legal-action projection, and effect execution

## Out of Scope

- validating raw queue entries or timing-window rank data beyond consuming ENG-010A validation results
- sorting no-choice entries with created event, source instance, or effect id tie-breakers
- creating `chooseTriggerOrder` or other pending decisions
- processing or executing queued effects
- integrating with phases, battle, play-card, actions, replay, CLI, server, client, database, Redis, WebSocket, React, live HTTP, or Poneglyph code

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/effect-queue-ordering.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/effect-queue-ordering.test.ts

## Constraints

- do not introduce `any`, routine non-null assertions, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-nocheck`
- do not export helper APIs from package entrypoints unless an existing production caller needs them
- keep engine-core deterministic and pure
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- unit test covering grouping by timing window, generation, ordering bucket, and `controllerId`
- unit test proving multiple entries in one player's bucket are reported as `chooseTriggerOrder`-required for that `controllerId`
- unit test proving single-entry buckets are no-choice buckets
- unit test proving grouping is deterministic for identical validated inputs
- unit test proving input queue entries are not mutated or reordered in place
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck` must pass
- `corepack pnpm run verify` must pass

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- grouping output exposes timing window, generation, ordering bucket, `controllerId`, and choice-required status
- buckets with more than one pending effect for the same player are identified as requiring `chooseTriggerOrder` for that `controllerId`
- single-entry buckets are identified as no-choice buckets without creating pending decisions
- grouping is deterministic for identical validated inputs across repeated runs
- input queues and entries are not mutated
- engine-core boundary remains pure and package entrypoints are unchanged
