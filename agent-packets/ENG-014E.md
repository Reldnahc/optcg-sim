## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s019 (Block Step)

1. Defender may activate one legal `[Blocker]`, unless blocking is prohibited.
2. Blocker rests and becomes the current target.
3. Emit `blockerActivated`.
4. Queue `[On Block]` effects.
5. Resolve the block timing window.
6. If attacker or current target left its zone or is no longer a legal battle participant, skip to End of Battle.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s021 (Damage Step)

1. Compute attacker and target power from `ComputedGameView`.
2. If attacker power is lower than target power, no damage/K.O. occurs.
3. If attacker power is equal or greater:
   - Target Leader: deal damage.
   - Target Character: K.O. target.
4. Emit events for damage, life movement, K.O., card movement.
5. Triggered effects during damage wait until damage processing completes.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s022 (End of Battle)

1. Queue/resolve end-of-battle triggers.
2. Expire battle-duration continuous effects.
3. Clear battle context.
4. Return to Main Phase.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s025 (Keyword behavior)

| Keyword         | Engine behavior                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rush            | Character may attack the turn it was played.                         |
| Rush: Character | Character may attack Characters, not Leader, the turn it was played. |
| Double Attack   | Leader damage count is 2.                                            |
| Banish          | Damaged life card is trashed; no normal trigger/hand path.           |
| Blocker         | During Block Step, can rest to redirect attack.                      |
| Unblockable     | Skips opponent blocker window.                                       |
| Activate: Main  | Legal only during controller's Main Phase outside battle.            |
| Main            | Event usable during controller's Main Phase.                         |
| Counter         | Event usable during opponent's Counter Step.                         |
| Once Per Turn   | Tracked by stable effect ID and card instance per turn.              |
| DON!! xX        | Condition is attached DON!! count greater than or equal to X.        |

### 02-engine-mechanics.s036 (DON!! card mechanics)

- Each DON!! attached to a Leader or Character grants +1000 power during the controller's turn only.
- During Main Phase, a player may give any number of active DON!! from cost area to their Leader or Characters.
- An attached DON!! card has `state: "attached"`; it is neither active nor rested while attached.
- When a card with attached DON!! leaves the field, all attached DON!! return to the owner's cost area rested.
- During Refresh Phase, all attached DON!! return to cost area rested, then the player's Leader, Characters, Stage, and DON!! in cost area become active.
- A `DON!! -X` cost may return the paying player's DON!! from cost area, attached to their Leader, or attached to their Characters unless the card text narrows the source. The paying player chooses the DON!! sources. If there are fewer than X eligible DON!! cards, the cost cannot be paid and the activation is illegal or declined before use is consumed.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s003 (Base state vs. computed view)

Separate base facts from derived values.

Base state stores:

- Which cards are in which zones.
- Active/rested state.
- Attached DON!! cards.
- Turn, phase, battle sub-step.
- Effect durations and source references.
- Pending decisions.

Computed view derives:

- Current power.
- Current cost.
- Granted/removed keywords.
- Attack/block restrictions.
- Protection from K.O. or other processes.
- Replacement candidates.

```ts
interface ComputedGameView {
  seq: StateSeq;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  cards: Record<InstanceId, ComputedCardView>;
  legalAttackTargets: Record<InstanceId, InstanceId[]>;
  restrictions: RestrictionIndex;
}

interface ComputedCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  basePower?: number;
  currentPower?: number;
  baseCost?: number;
  currentCost?: number;
  keywords: Keyword[];
  canAttack: boolean;
  canBlock: boolean;
  cannotBeAttacked: boolean;
  protectedFrom: Protection[];
}
```

Do not persist derived current power as canonical state unless a rule explicitly changes a base value. Recompute from base state and continuous modifiers.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s009 (Pending decisions)

Effects, costs, target selection, optional activation, simultaneous trigger ordering, and life triggers all pause through the same model.

```ts
type PendingDecision =
  | ChooseTriggerOrderDecision
  | ChooseOptionalActivationDecision
  | PayCostDecision
  | SelectTargetsDecision
  | SelectCardsDecision
  | ChooseEffectOptionDecision
  | ConfirmLifeTriggerDecision
  | OrderCardsDecision
  | MulliganDecision
  | DeclareLoopCountDecision
  | RollbackConsentDecision;

interface BaseDecision {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  defaultResponse?: DecisionResponse;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
}
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s015 (Legal actions)

`getLegalActions()` should return actions valid for the current game state and current pending decision.

```ts
function getLegalActions(state: GameState, playerId: PlayerId): LegalAction[] {
  if (state.pendingDecision) {
    return legalResponsesForDecision(state.pendingDecision, playerId, state);
  }

  return legalPhaseActions(state, playerId);
}
```

Legal actions sent to a client must not leak hidden information. For example, the opponent should not receive an action list that implies exactly which hidden counter cards exist.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s016 (Action envelope inside the engine)

The server-facing protocol envelope is defined separately. The engine action should be pure data.

```ts
type Action =
  | { type: "playCard"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; costPayment?: PaymentSpec }
  | {
      type: "activateEffect";
      source: CardRef;
      effectId: string;
      costPayment?: PaymentSpec;
    }
  | { type: "attachDon"; donInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; cardInstanceId: InstanceId; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | {
      type: "respondToDecision";
      decisionId: string;
      response: DecisionResponse;
    };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s018 (Canonical event visibility)

Each `EngineEvent` has one visibility policy:

```text
public          safe for both players immediately
private         visible only to listed player IDs
replayOnly      hidden during live play but available in completed full replay
serverOnly      never leaves trusted server/runtime logs
```

Visibility is independent of replay determinism. Replay artifacts may store information that was never sent to either player during the live match.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s023 (Error handling inside the engine)

Engine errors are classified.

```ts
type EngineError =
  | { type: "illegalAction"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invalidDecisionResponse"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invariantViolation"; invariant: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "unsupportedCard"; cardId: CardId; status: CardSupportStatus }
  | { type: "effectRuntimeError"; effectId: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "loopDetected"; signature: LoopSignature };
```

Illegal player actions are rejected and logged. Invariant violations and effect runtime errors freeze or recover the match according to the recovery policy.

### 06-visibility-security.s017 (Filter checklist)

Before any state leaves the server:

```ts
assertNoDeckContents(view);
assertNoOpponentHandContents(view);
assertNoFaceDownLifeContents(view);
assertNoRngState(view);
assertNoEffectQueueInternals(view);
assertNoPrivateDecisionCandidates(view);
assertRevealRecordsAreRecipientFiltered(view);
assertLegalActionsDoNotLeakOpponentHiddenInfo(view);
assertSpectatorPolicyApplied(view);
```

Run these in tests for every `PlayerView` fixture.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 11-testing-quality.s010 (Golden replay tests)

Store known game scripts and final state hashes.

```text
fixtures/replays/
  vanilla-basic-game.json
  blocker-counter-basic.json
  double-attack-life-trigger.json
  simultaneous-ko-triggers.json
  replacement-trigger-trash.json
```

CI replays them and checks:

- Final state hash.
- Checkpoint hashes.
- Event count/type sequence, optionally.
- No hidden-info leak in generated views.

### 11-testing-quality.s012 (Replay drift tests)

Whenever engine or effect definitions change:

1. Replay previous golden logs under the intended version bundle.
2. Compare checkpoint hashes.
3. Fail CI on unexpected drift.
4. Require migration/version-pin note for intentional drift.

### 18-acceptance-tests.s004 (Milestone 2 - first effect runtime)

```text
M2-001 On Play draw queues and resolves
M2-002 When Attacking effect resolves before defender On Opponent Attack window
M2-003 blocker redirects attack and emits blockerActivated
M2-004 counter character grants battle power until end of battle
M2-005 counter event is trashed and effect resolves
M2-006 On K.O. activates on field and resolves from trash or last known info
M2-007 life Trigger resolves from no zone then moves to trash unless replaced
M2-008 simultaneous triggers controlled by same player require order decision
M2-009 turn player effect A, opponent effect B, new turn-player effect C resolves A-B-C
M2-010 damage-processing triggers wait until all damage points complete
M2-011 continuous +1000 modifier does not mutate base state
M2-012 replacement effect applies once per process
M2-013 optional effect creates chooseOptionalActivation decision
M2-014 target selection respects visibility and legal candidates
M2-015 unsupported non-vanilla card is rejected outside dev sandbox
M2-016 once-per-turn failed cost does not consume use
M2-017 once-per-turn committed effect that later fizzles still consumes use
M2-018 defender on-opponent-attack effects resolve before ordinary counter actions
M2-019 post-counter missing attacker or target skips Damage Step
M2-020 replacement choice uses chooseReplacement decision and logs replacementApplied
M2-021 replacement cannot apply twice to same process
M2-022 transient revealed card returned face-down is removed from opponent view
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only test and fixture coverage for the completed ENG-014 Blocker vertical. Stop before production behavior changes or broadening support into Counter, Unblockable, On Block effects, replacement, or effect-runtime paths.

## Scope

- add or tighten tests proving the complete Blocker vertical is deterministic from attack declaration through blocker decision response, activation, and blocked-battle resolution
- prove computed `canBlock` remains true only for active defender Blockers during Block Step and false outside Block Step or for rested, wrong-controller, Leader, non-Blocker, and stale cases
- prove `blockerActivated`, damage/K.O./movement/DON return, end-battle, rule-processing, and event journal ordering are stable
- prove legal-action and pending-decision filtering does not expose blocker decisions or responses to the wrong player or outside Block Step
- prove hidden-information filters still pass after Blocker states and events using hidden-info tests or player-view assertions without adding hidden-info fixtures unless explicitly needed
- add replay smoke coverage if existing replay conventions support the sequence without schema changes; fixture edits are allowed only under `fixtures/replays/**`
- preserve fail-closed tests for On Block effects, Counter, Unblockable, replacement state, pending runtime queues, deferred triggers, Double Attack/Banish combinations, and stale battle participants

## Out of Scope

- production behavior changes
- new runtime primitives
- Counter, Unblockable, On Block, replacement, or effect queue behavior
- replay schema changes
- CLI/server/client behavior

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/actions.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/compute-view.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/replay-smoke.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/action-test-fixtures.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions-test-fixtures.ts
- fixtures/replays/**
- tests/hidden-info/**

## Constraints

- create the ENG-014E substory branch from the approved ENG-014 parent integration branch and open the ENG-014E PR against that parent branch after human approval of the parent workflow
- keep this story test-only
- if production behavior must change, stop and split or record the ambiguity
- fail closed on replay, hidden-information, or timing ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- regression test for full Blocker event order and final state hash stability
- regression test proving `canBlock` is true only for active defender Blocker during Block Step and false outside Block Step and for rested, wrong-controller, Leader, non-Blocker, and stale cases
- regression test proving legal blocker decision responses are absent for the attacker, wrong phase/step, pending decisions, and pending runtime work
- regression tests for unsupported On Block, Counter, Unblockable, replacement, Double Attack/Banish, effect queue, deferred trigger, and stale participant cases
- hidden-info or player-view test proving Blocker battle state and legal actions do not expose hidden zones
- existing replay smoke tests pass, with a Blocker smoke added only if no replay schema change is needed
- `corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/actions.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/compute-view.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/replay-smoke.test.ts tests/hidden-info` must pass
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck` must pass
- `corepack pnpm run verify` must pass

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- no production files are changed
- Blocker has explicit computed-view, decision/legal-action, and battle-action regression coverage
- unsupported blocker-adjacent paths remain fail-closed with no partial mutation
- state hash and event journal stability coverage exists for the supported Blocker vertical
