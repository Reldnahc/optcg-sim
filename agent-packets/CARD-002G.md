# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: CARD-002G
Epic ID: CARD-002
Title: Add future effect story manifest guidance
Type: implementation
Area: docs
Primary Concern: docs

## Why

Add workflow guidance so future Main Event, Counter Event, optional effects, once-per-turn, permanent modifier, replacement, multi-damage, and search/reveal stories use the representative cards-produced manifest by default and justify synthetic one-off manifests when needed.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s039 (Damage-processing deferral)

When damage is 2 or more, process each point of damage separately. Effects that trigger during damage processing wait until all damage processing completes before resolving. This matches the original note tied to rule 8-6-2.

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

### 04-effect-runtime.s007 (Source presence policy)

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | "mustRemainInSameZone"
  | "resolveFromDestinationZone"
  | "resolveFromLastKnownInformation"
  | "noSourceRequired";
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind           | Policy                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[When Attacking]`            | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On Block]`                  | `mustRemainInSameZone`                                                                                |
| `[On K.O.]`                   | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life         | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone                              |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]`  | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed                                                   |
| Global rule-created effect    | `noSourceRequired`                                                                                    |

### 04-effect-runtime.s009 (Queue ordering)

Every trigger collection creates or joins a timing window. Queue order is deterministic and must not depend on JavaScript array discovery order except where the spec explicitly says discovery order is the canonical tie-breaker.

Normative ordering algorithm:

```text
1. Assign every collected trigger a timingWindowId.
2. Assign generation = 0 for effects triggered by the original timing event.
3. When resolving an effect produces new triggers, enqueue them with generation = currentGeneration + 1 in the same timing window unless a new official timing window has opened.
4. Resolve older timing windows before newer timing windows.
5. Within a timing window, resolve lower generation before higher generation.
6. Within a generation, resolve turn-player bucket before non-turn-player bucket.
7. Within a player's bucket, if more than one effect is pending, create chooseTriggerOrder for that player.
8. If no choice is required, use stable tie-breakers: createdAtEventSeq, then source instance id, then effect id.
```

Consequences:

- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are pending, and A creates turn player effect C while resolving, B resolves before C.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage points are complete, except `[Trigger]` resolution itself.
- Effects triggered during an effect or card activation wait until the triggering process completes.
- Optional triggered effects create `chooseOptionalActivation` decisions at the point they would enter or begin resolution, according to the card's timing rule.

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s013 (Replacement effects)

Replacement effects intercept replaceable processes.

```ts
interface ReplacementProcess {
  id: string;
  type: ReplaceableProcessType;
  source?: CardRef;
  target?: CardRef;
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  usedReplacementIds: string[];
}
```

Processing order:

1. Replacements generated by the card/process being replaced, if applicable.
2. Turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.
3. Non-turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.

A replacement cannot apply twice to the same replacement process. If a replacement cannot actually perform its replacement, it does not apply.

```ts
function executeReplaceableProcess(
  state: GameState,
  process: ReplacementProcess,
): EngineStepResult {
  let current = process;
  let currentState = state;

  while (true) {
    const replacements = findApplicableReplacements(currentState, current)
      .filter((r) => !current.usedReplacementIds.includes(r.id))
      .filter((r) => canApplyReplacement(r, currentState, current));

    if (replacements.length === 0) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    const choice = chooseReplacementByPriorityOrDecision(
      currentState,
      replacements,
      current,
    );

    if (choice.pausedForDecision) {
      return choice.result;
    }

    if (!choice.chosen) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    current = {
      ...transformProcessByReplacement(choice.chosen, currentState, current),
      usedReplacementIds: [...current.usedReplacementIds, choice.chosen.id],
    };

    currentState = emitReplacementApplied(
      currentState,
      choice.chosen,
      current,
    ).state;
  }
}
```

Replacement decisions use `PendingDecision.chooseReplacement`. Optional replacements may be declined; mandatory replacements cannot be declined unless more than one mandatory replacement requires a controller-chosen order. A replacement cannot apply twice to the same `process.id`, even if the process is transformed into a new shape.

Every applied replacement emits `replacementApplied` with the original process ID, selected replacement ID, old process payload hash, and transformed process payload hash. This event is at least `replayOnly` and may be public when the replacement effect is public.

### 04-effect-runtime.s014 (Continuous effects as computed view)

Continuous and permanent effects do not mutate canonical state on every recalculation. They generate modifiers, and a computed view applies them.

```ts
interface ContinuousEffectRecord {
  id: string;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  controller: PlayerId;
  modifier: Modifier;
  duration: Duration;
  condition?: Condition;
  createdBy: CausalityRef;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

interface Modifier {
  layer: ModifierLayer;
  target: TargetSpec;
  operation: ModifierOperation;
}

type ModifierLayer =
  | "basePowerSet"
  | "baseCostSet"
  | "powerAdd"
  | "costAdd"
  | "keywordAdd"
  | "keywordRemove"
  | "restriction"
  | "protection";
```

Computing a view:

```ts
function computeView(state: GameState): ComputedGameView {
  const base = buildBaseView(state);
  const activeModifiers = collectActiveContinuousEffects(state);
  return applyModifierLayers(base, activeModifiers, state.turn.turnPlayerId);
}
```

Permanent effects may depend on the computed state. If the official rule requires fixed-point behavior, implement the fixed-point over computed views, not by writing current power/cost into canonical state.

### 04-effect-runtime.s017 (Transient reveal and selection sets)

Transient sets are part of effect execution context, not normal zones. They exist for patterns such as revealing the top card, selecting from a revealed set, and returning unselected cards face-down.

Rules:

1. A transient set has an origin, visibility, and cleanup policy.
2. Cards in a transient set are not simultaneously in hand/deck/trash/life.
3. Movement from a transient set to a real zone must emit a `cardMoved` event with appropriate visibility.
4. If an effect exits early, cleanup policy runs before the queue continues.
5. Opponent views may see a revealed card only for the duration and visibility specified by the effect. If the card returns face-down to a hidden zone, future opponent views must not retain its ID.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s012 (Deck validation)

Deck validation resolves and validates against Poneglyph IDs, Poneglyph legality records, and simulator support metadata. Poneglyph is the canonical external source for format/card legality inputs such as legal status, bans, and copy limits; the simulator may only layer unsupported-card policy or platform-specific constraints on top.

```ts
interface DeckValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: DeckValidationError[];
  warnings: DeckValidationWarning[];
  resolvedCards: ResolvedDeckCard[];
  versions: {
    cardDataVersion: string;
    effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
    overlayVersion: string;
    banlistVersion: string;
  };
}
```

Validation checks:

- Leader count and leader identity.
- Main deck size.
- DON!! deck size.
- Leader/color restrictions.
- Per-card copy limits by Poneglyph base `cardId`.
- Official format restrictions.
- Simulator-specific bans.
- Unsupported-card status.
- Variant IDs resolve to valid Poneglyph variants for the base card.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 24-story-schema.s016 (`spec_refs`)

List of exact spec section references that authorize the story. These references are mandatory. In v6, `spec_refs` should use stable `SECTION_REF` identifiers such as `07-match-server-protocol.s010 (Timers)` instead of renderer-specific heading anchors. The story must not ask the agent to invent uncited behavior.

### 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s015 (Recommended completion checks for story-driven implementation)

A story should not be marked done unless:

- code behavior matches the cited spec,
- required tests are present and pass,
- repo verification passes,
- the patch stays within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points or the story is updated and re-approved first,
- no prohibited scope creep is introduced,
- any new ambiguity is surfaced explicitly.

After a story is marked done, it should not remain under `stories/approved/`, should not retain an active packet, and should not remain listed in `agent-packets/active.json`. The parent agent owns this cleanup because story state and packet authority are orchestration concerns, not worker or reviewer subagent concerns. Repos should provide a single command for normal single-story completion and a multi-story command for parent-story integration cleanup so story movement, packet removal, and manifest cleanup cannot drift independently. Multi-story cleanup tooling must fail closed when manifest or packet evidence for any listed story is missing or stale.

For parent-story integration branches, substories may remain approved after their substory PRs merge into the parent integration branch because the authoritative merge to `main` has not happened yet. This exception is valid only when the user explicitly approved parent-level human review for the decomposed story group, every substory PR has CI and reviewer-subagent review records, and the final parent PR receives full-story integration review plus human review before merge to `main`.

During that parent-branch window, `agent-packets/active.json` remains a single-story handoff pointer for the currently active or most recently active substory packet. It should not be read as the inventory of unfinished substories. Substories merged only into the parent integration branch stay approved and keep their packet files until the parent PR lands on `main`, even when they no longer appear in `active.json`.

Before human review is requested on a parent PR, the PR body or a handoff comment should be updated from future-tense review plans to completed-gate evidence: included substory PRs, full-story AI review record, revision response, CI result, repo verification result, remaining human-review requirement, and the post-merge `packets:complete-many` cleanup plan.

A commit that contains only the exact file changes produced by the packet completion command is a generated lifecycle cleanup and does not need a separate reviewer-subagent pass. Run the repo verification command before pushing that cleanup. If cleanup requires any manual edit beyond the command output, including edits to packet files, `agent-packets/active.json`, tooling, tests, fixtures, specs, workflow docs, or story files, it is no longer pure generated cleanup and should receive the normal reviewer-subagent pass before push or merge.

Post-merge cleanup metadata is a reviewed cleanup request, not standalone
authority to mutate story state. Cleanup automation must bind the requested
cleanup to reviewed pull-request evidence, the merge state, trusted checked-in
approved story files, current packet evidence, and, for parent cleanup, included
substory evidence before packet completion runs. It must fail closed when
cleanup metadata is absent, malformed, stale, unbound to reviewed evidence, or
names a story that is not eligible for completion.

The cleanup workflow must check out trusted `main` or default-branch code, not
unreviewed pull-request branch code. A direct cleanup commit may be pushed only
by the dedicated cleanup actor after packet-completion output is proven exact
and repo-approved verification passes. The automation must not open a cleanup
pull request. Manual fallback is only for operational failure, not the normal
path. Branch deletion may run only after packet lifecycle cleanup succeeds and
only for associated merged, unprotected story or substory branches.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own future-story guidance for manifest fixture selection only. Do not implement effect runtime behavior, card effects, server/client behavior, manifest fixture changes, or package-boundary enforcement in this story.

## Scope

- document that upcoming effect-runtime stories should use the representative cards-produced manifest by default
- identify Main Event, Counter Event, optional effects, once-per-turn, permanent modifier, replacement, multi-damage, and search/reveal story families as default consumers
- document when a synthetic one-off manifest is allowed for narrow edge cases
- require the story or PR to explain any synthetic one-off manifest exception
- keep unsupported gameplay status honest rather than using fixture adoption to imply support

## Out of Scope

- implementing Main Event, Counter Event, optional effects, once-per-turn, permanent modifier, replacement, multi-damage, or search/reveal behavior
- changing representative fixture contents
- package-boundary enforcement
- CLI or hidden-info tests
- server, client, UI, or protocol work

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- docs/**
- docs/workflow/**
- stories/generated/CARD-002G-future-effect-story-manifest-guidance.yaml
- stories/approved/CARD-002G-future-effect-story-manifest-guidance.yaml
- agent-packets/CARD-002G.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- keep this story documentation-only except for required story and packet files
- do not mention roadmap milestone names in the title or scope
- do not implement gameplay behavior
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

## Required Tests

- documentation link or markdown lint check if the repo has one
- `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- full `corepack pnpm verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- future-story guidance names the representative cards-produced manifest as the default
- guidance requires a documented reason for any synthetic one-off manifest
- guidance prevents unsupported fixture cards from being presented as implemented gameplay

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
```
