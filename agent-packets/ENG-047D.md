## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s006 (Event visibility)

Events may contain hidden data. Filter them before sending to clients.

```ts
type EventVisibility =
  | { type: "public" }
  | { type: "private"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "hidden" }
  | { type: "replayOnly" };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s015 (Legal actions)

`getLegalActions()` should return actions valid for the current game state and current pending decision.

```ts
function getLegalActions(state: GameState, playerId: PlayerId): LegalAction[] {
  if (state.pendingDecision) {
    return legalResponsesForDecision(state.pendingDecision, playerId, state);
  }

  return legalPhaseActions(state, playerId);
}
```

Legal actions sent to a client must not leak hidden information. For example, the opponent should not receive an action list that implies exactly which hidden counter cards exist.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s018 (Canonical event visibility)

Each `EngineEvent` has one visibility policy:

```text
public          safe for both players immediately
private         visible only to listed player IDs
replayOnly      hidden during live play but available in completed full replay
serverOnly      never leaves trusted server/runtime logs
```

Visibility is independent of replay determinism. Replay artifacts may store information that was never sent to either player during the live match.

### 06-visibility-security.s002 (Security principle)

The server holds `GameState`. Clients receive filtered views. A raw `GameState` must never leave the match server except for trusted internal debugging, persistence, or completed replay storage.

```ts
filterStateForPlayer(state, playerId) -> PlayerView
filterStateForSpectator(state, spectatorPolicy) -> SpectatorView
filterStateForReplay(state) -> ReplayView
```

If a field is not explicitly allowed in a view, it is hidden.

### 06-visibility-security.s003 (Player zone visibility)

| Zone           | Self view                        | Opponent view                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Deck           | Count only                       | Count only                       |
| DON!! Deck     | Count only / cosmetic art policy | Count only / cosmetic art policy |
| Hand           | Full card data                   | Count only                       |
| Trash          | Full ordered public data         | Full ordered public data         |
| Leader Area    | Full public data                 | Full public data                 |
| Character Area | Full public data                 | Full public data                 |
| Stage Area     | Full public data                 | Full public data                 |
| Cost Area      | Full public DON!! state          | Full public DON!! state          |
| Life Area      | Count + face-up cards only       | Count + face-up cards only       |
| No Zone        | Only if revealed to that player  | Only if revealed to that player  |

### 06-visibility-security.s004 (PlayerView shape)

```ts
interface PlayerView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  self: VisiblePlayerState;
  opponent: OpponentVisibleState;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PublicDecision;
  legalActions: PublicLegalAction[];
  revealedCards: PublicRevealRecord[];
  events: EngineEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Do not include:

- Deck order.
- Opponent hand card IDs.
- Face-down life card IDs.
- RNG seed/internal state.
- Effect queue internals.
- Private decision candidates not visible to recipient.
- Internal crash/recovery metadata.

Canonical public support DTOs for the initial live view contract:

```ts
type SpectatorPolicy = {
  mode: "disabled" | "live-filtered";
  allowHandRevealAfterGame: boolean;
};

interface PublicTurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}

interface PublicBattleState {
  attacker: CardRef;
  originalTarget: CardRef;
  currentTarget: CardRef;
  blocker?: CardRef;
  step: BattleStep;
  damageCount: number;
}

interface PublicCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  attachedDonCount: number;
  turnPlayed?: number;
}

interface PublicLifeView {
  count: number;
  faceUpCards: PublicCardView[];
}

interface VisiblePlayerState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  hand: PublicCardView[];
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

interface OpponentVisibleState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  handCount: number;
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

type SpectatorVisiblePlayerState = OpponentVisibleState;

interface PublicDecision {
  id: DecisionId;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

type PublicLegalAction =
  | { type: "playCard"; card: CardRef; costPaymentRequired?: boolean }
  | { type: "activateEffect"; source: CardRef; effectId: EffectId }
  | { type: "attachDon"; don: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; card: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "respondToDecision"; decisionId: DecisionId };

interface PublicRevealRecord {
  id: string;
  cards: CardRef[];
  visibility: "public" | "privateToRecipient";
  origin: ZoneRef | "topOfDeck" | "lifeDamage" | "custom";
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  cleanupPolicy: "returnToOrigin" | "trashAfterResolution" | "none";
}

type SpectatorRevealRecord = Omit<PublicRevealRecord, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: "public";
};

type SpectatorEvent = Omit<EngineEvent, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: { type: "public" };
};
```

Initial live-filtered spectator view is distinct from `PlayerView`:

```ts
interface SpectatorView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  spectatorPolicy: SpectatorPolicy;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, SpectatorVisiblePlayerState>;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  revealedCards: SpectatorRevealRecord[];
  events: SpectatorEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Initial `SpectatorView` has no `pendingDecision` or `legalActions` field.
It does not include either player's hand card IDs, deck order, face-down life
card IDs, private reveal records, non-public events, RNG state, effect queue
internals, or audit entries. Full-information live spectating is deferred to a
future explicit policy story.

### 06-visibility-security.s006 (Effect event visibility)

The game log can leak information if not filtered.

```ts
interface EffectEvent {
  id: string;
  sourceCardId: CardId;
  sourceInstanceId?: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  description: string;
  choices?: PublicChoiceSummary;
  visibleTo: "both" | PlayerId[] | "replayOnly";
}
```

Examples:

- Public target selection: visible to both.
- Searching deck: opponent sees "Opponent is searching deck" and maybe count, not card IDs.
- Choosing a card from hand to trash: opponent sees the resulting public trash card, not pre-choice hand options.

### 06-visibility-security.s007 (Legal-action visibility)

Legal actions can leak hidden information. The view should expose only what that recipient is entitled to know.

Examples:

- The defender should not see exactly why the server auto-passed the counter window.
- A player may see their own legal counter cards.
- The opponent sees only that the game progressed, not whether no counters existed or auto-pass was enabled.

### 06-visibility-security.s023 (Security checklist from source spec)

Before sending any match data to a player, spectator, or replay consumer, assert:

- Opponent hand contains only count, not card IDs.
- Decks expose count only, not order or card IDs.
- Face-down life exposes count only, not card IDs.
- Revealed life cards are visible only while legally revealed.
- Private search/look candidates are visible only to the searching player unless `reveal=true`.
- RNG seed/state is absent.
- Internal effect queue is absent.
- Pending decisions are recipient-filtered.
- Auto-pass timing does not reveal whether hidden counter options existed.
- Spectator delay/filter policy was applied.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 22-v6-implementation-tightening.s009 (5. Phase and battle timing)

The engine now has explicit handling for:

- start-of-main-phase trigger collection before the active player receives Main Phase action priority,
- defender-side opponent-attack effects before ordinary counter actions,
- post-Counter-Step legality check before Damage Step,
- attached DON!! having no active/rested state while attached,
- `DON!! -X` cost sources and failure behavior,
- precise once-per-turn consumption timing.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own hidden-info regressions and minimal projection fixes required by the supported ENG-047 path. Do not broaden public DTO contracts, server protocol, replay viewer behavior, or client UI.

## Scope

- ensure PlayerView exposes active eligible top-card candidates only to the chooser while the chooser-only reveal is active
- ensure opponent views see only deck counts and public progress when reveal visibility is chooser-only
- ensure public events do not leak hidden deck order or unchosen hidden card identities
- ensure legal actions and metadata remain content-agnostic for hidden candidates
- ensure stale reveal candidates disappear from all public/player-facing outputs after cleanup

## Out of Scope

- changing full GameState ownership
- replay viewer behavior
- server/client/API/UI work
- broad hidden-info helper rewrites

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-047D packet while implementing this story
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-047 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- focused PlayerView/event/legal-action hidden-info regressions
- run `corepack pnpm run test:hidden-info`
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck`
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`
- run `corepack pnpm run verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- chooser PlayerView can see active revealed candidates according to chooser-only effect visibility
- unauthorized PlayerView does not include hidden candidate identities, deck order, or stale transient state
- legal actions remain hidden-content agnostic
- public event payloads do not leak private reveal data

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer
