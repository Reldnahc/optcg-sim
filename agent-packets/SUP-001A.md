# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: SUP-001A
Epic ID: SUP-001
Title: DON field-count condition contract fixture authority
Type: implementation
Area: contracts
Primary Concern: contract

## Why

Pin the existing Effect DSL `fieldCount` plus `CardFilter` contract/schema authority for public DON-on-field count conditions so downstream engine and cards stories can represent text such as `you have 6 or less DON!! cards on your field` without adding a DON-specific condition primitive or card-specific condition strings.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s036 (DON!! card mechanics)

- Each DON!! attached to a Leader or Character grants +1000 power during the controller's turn only.
- During Main Phase, a player may give any number of active DON!! from cost area to their Leader or Characters.
- An attached DON!! card has `state: "attached"`; it is neither active nor rested while attached.
- When a card with attached DON!! leaves the field, all attached DON!! return to the owner's cost area rested.
- During Refresh Phase, all attached DON!! return to cost area rested, then the player's Leader, Characters, Stage, and DON!! in cost area become active.
- A `DON!! -X` cost may return the paying player's DON!! from cost area, attached to their Leader, or attached to their Characters unless the card text narrows the source. The paying player chooses the DON!! sources. If there are fewer than X eligible DON!! cards, the cost cannot be paid and the activation is illegal or declined before use is consumed.

### 04-effect-runtime.s011 (Conditions and costs)

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

Optionality has three distinct meanings:

- Optional activation asks whether the player commits to resolving the effect block. Declining optional activation means the effect block is not legally committed and once-per-turn usage is not consumed.
- Optional cost asks whether the player pays a non-mandatory cost inside an otherwise committed effect. Declining or failing an optional cost records `paidCost: false` and only skips later instructions whose connector or text depends on that cost being paid.
- Optional effect clause asks whether the player performs a non-mandatory instruction during resolution. Declining an optional effect clause records `playerDeclined: true` for that segment and does not undo prior legally completed segments.

Optional cost clauses inside composed execution are not effect-block activation
costs. They occur after legal commitment to the effect block, inside a
resumable sequence segment. Optional cost accept, decline, and failure do not
consume once-per-turn usage because usage was consumed at legal commitment
before the optional cost clause executes. Accepted optional costs pay cost
atomically and emit the normal cost-payment events. Declined optional costs do
not emit cost-payment events. Failed optional costs emit no public event that
reveals hidden payment candidates or private payment details.

Accepted optional cost records `attempted: true`, `succeeded: true`,
`paidCost: true`, and `playerDeclined: false`; `changedState` records whether
canonical state actually changed. Declined optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: true`. Failed optional cost records
`attempted: true`, `succeeded: false`, `changedState: false`,
`paidCost: false`, and `playerDeclined: false`. Optional cost accept, decline,
and failure do not consume once-per-turn usage, and dependent connectors use
`paidCost` rather than optional-activation state.
Event `seq` values and `state.seq` advancement remain deterministic for
optional cost accept, decline, and failure. State hashes include the frame
segment result for each branch.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s003 (Top-level definition)

```ts
interface EffectDefinition {
  cardId: CardId;
  implementationStatus: CardSupportStatus;
  effects: EffectBlock[];
  metadata: EffectDefinitionMetadata;
}

interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  sourceTextHash: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  tested: boolean;
  reviewer?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s004 (Effect block)

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string;
  category: "auto" | "activate" | "permanent" | "replacement";
  trigger: Trigger;
  condition?: Condition;
  conditionTiming?: "activation" | "resolution" | "both";
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s006 (Conditions)

```ts
type Condition =
  | { type: "donCount"; target?: Target; min: number }
  | { type: "yourTurn" }
  | { type: "opponentTurn" }
  | { type: "lifeCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "fieldCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "handCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "trashCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "leaderColorCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "hasCardInZone"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter: CardFilter }
  | { type: "attackTarget"; targetType: "leader" | "character" | "any" }
  | { type: "cardState"; target: Target; state: "active" | "rested" }
  | { type: "sourceStillInZone" }
  | { type: "eventPayload"; path: string; op: Comparator; value: unknown }
  | { type: "and"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "or"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "not"; condition: Condition }
  | { type: "custom"; check: string };

type Comparator = "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte";
type PlayerRef =
  | "self"
  | "opponent"
  | "turnPlayer"
  | "nonTurnPlayer"
  | "owner"
  | "controller";
```

`leaderColorCount` is a public Leader metadata condition. It reads only the
player's Leader colors from the match manifest or resolved card snapshot, uses a
canonical `PlayerRef` and `Comparator`, and its `value` is a non-negative safe
integer. Printed "multicolored" Leader conditions map to
`{ type: "leaderColorCount", player: "self", op: "gte", value: 2 }`.

Leader type and Leader attribute conditions do not introduce `leaderType` or
`leaderAttribute` predicates. Represent them through the public Leader Area with
`hasCardInZone` and `CardFilter`, for example
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], typesAny: ["Straw Hat Crew"] } }`
or
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], attributesAny: ["slash"] } }`.
The schema-supported fixture subset admits only this public Leader-zone metadata
form and does not authorize private-zone metadata queries.

Condition, duration, and restriction primitives outside the schema-supported fixture subset remain planned layers. They are contract-defined by this reference, but they are not fixture-authorable until the schema coverage policy lists them as supported.

For public DON-on-field count authorability, use existing `fieldCount` with a
DON filter (`filter.categories` containing `"don"`), canonical comparator, and
non-negative threshold. In this DON filter form, schema fixtures support
`player: "self"` and `player: "opponent"` only, and reject free-text shortcuts.
This is contract/schema authorability evidence only and does not by itself imply
runtime executable support, parser certification, generated support, or card
playability.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s009 (Card filters)

```ts
interface CardFilter {
  cardIds?: CardId[];
  names?: string[];
  nameContains?: string;
  nameNot?: string[];
  categories?: CardCategory[];
  colorsAny?: Color[];
  colorsAll?: Color[];
  typesAny?: string[];
  typesAll?: string[];
  attributesAny?: Attribute[];
  attributesAll?: Attribute[];
  cost?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  power?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  counter?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  hasKeywords?: Keyword[];
  lacksKeywords?: Keyword[];
  state?: "active" | "rested" | "attached";
  owner?: PlayerRef;
  controller?: PlayerRef;
  excludeSelf?: boolean;
  custom?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s022 (Poneglyph text-to-DSL pipeline)

The effect-system plan supports three authoring paths:

1. Manual DSL definitions written by developers.
2. Custom TypeScript handlers for cards that cannot be expressed in DSL.
3. Generated DSL from Poneglyph printed card text when certified parser rules produce a complete parse and runtime capability checks pass.

Support ladder:

1. `contract-defined`: a primitive or behavior is described by the Markdown spec or canonical TypeScript contract.
2. `schema-authorable`: `contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` can validate JSON fixtures for that primitive.
3. `runtime-executable`: the current runtime capability matrix proves the engine can execute the primitive, including decisions, visibility, replay, failure policy, and pause/resume behavior.
4. `parser-certified`: reviewed parser rules produce a complete parse for the relevant printed text shape.
5. `generated-support playable`: a generated support record may enable normal play only when the parse is complete and every parsed component has current runtime capability evidence.

Schema authorability alone is insufficient for generated-support playable status. Generated support requires runtime capability evidence and complete parser support; schema validation only proves a JSON shape can be authored.

Generated definitions must never be deployed blindly. A new parser rule, ambiguous parse class, custom handler binding, or wording/ruling ambiguity requires review before it can certify support. Once a parser rule is certified, matching complete-parse cards may be generated without a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map for that common template.

A complete parse covers all gameplay-relevant printed text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement or optionality semantics, and ruling/errata inputs that affect behavior. Multiple parsed effects compose into one generated `EffectDefinition`. Partial parse output may be reported for coverage progress, but it must not make the card playable in normal modes.

Bandai or Poneglyph wording drift must invalidate the affected parse/hash evidence or downgrade support until parser and support evidence are updated. If any parsed component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing runtime capability evidence, the generated definition fails closed instead of partially enabling the card.

```ts
interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  source: "poneglyph";
  sourceTextHash: string;
  generatedBy?: "manual" | "rule-parser" | "llm-assisted";
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewedAt?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s029 (Schema coverage policy)

`contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` is the executable JSON fixture contract.
TypeScript/spec primitives outside that JSON schema are planned/not
fixture-authorable until schema validation and fixtures exist.
This list is the fixture-authorability boundary, not generated playable support.
Schema authorability alone does not imply runtime-executable,
parser-certified, or generated-support playable status. New TYP schema stories
may move primitives into the schema-supported fixture subset only when they also
add schema coverage and validation fixtures; generated playable support still
requires complete parser support and runtime capability evidence.

Schema-supported fixture subset:

- trigger: onPlay
- trigger: whenAttacking
- trigger: onOpponentAttack
- trigger: onBlock
- trigger: onKO
- trigger: endOfYourTurn
- trigger: endOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: trigger
- trigger: activateMain
- trigger: main
- trigger: counter
- trigger: permanent
- trigger: startOfGame
- trigger: startOfYourTurn
- trigger: startOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: startOfMainPhase
- trigger: endOfBattle
- trigger: donAttach
- trigger: custom
- condition: yourTurn
- condition: attachedDonCount
- condition: fieldCount
- condition: fieldCount DON filter authorability uses existing `fieldCount` +
  `CardFilter` (`categories` containing `don`) with `player` limited to `self`
  or `opponent`; this remains schema-authorability-only evidence and is not
  runtime/playability support
- condition: trashCount (public `player` + `op` + non-negative safe-integer `value`; optional public filter)
- cost: restDon
- cost: returnDon
- cost: restSelf
- cost: sequence
- target: self, myLeader, opponentLeader, attacker, attackTarget, blocker,
  triggerCard, all, choose, savedFieldObject
- duration: thisAction
- duration: thisBattle
- duration: thisTurn
- duration: untilEndOfTurn
- duration: untilStartOfNextTurn
- duration: whileSourceOnField
- duration: permanent
- effect: draw
- effect: drawUpTo
- effect: ko
- effect: modifyPower
- effect: payCost
- effect: selectCards
- effect: selectTargets
- effect: playSelected
- effect: sequence
- effect: cannotAttack
- effect: cannotBlock
- effect: giveKeyword
- effect: giveProtection (structured `Protection` metadata only; includes TYP-012A field-removal metadata shape)
- effect: custom
- card filters: cardIds, names, nameContains, nameNot, categories, colorsAny,
  colorsAll, typesAny, typesAll, attributesAny, attributesAll, cost, power,
  counter, hasKeywords, lacksKeywords, state, owner, controller, excludeSelf,
  custom

Planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage exists:

- condition: donCount
- condition: opponentTurn
- condition: lifeCount
- condition: handCount
- condition: hasCardInZone
- condition: attackTarget
- condition: cardState
- condition: sourceStillInZone
- condition: eventPayload
- condition: and, or, not, custom
- cost: trashFromHand
- cost: trashSelf
- cost: trashFromField
- cost: discard
- cost: chooseOne
- cost: custom
- duration: whileConditionTrue
- effect: search
- effect: lookAtTop
- effect: revealFromZone
- effect: revealTop
- effect: selectFromSet
- effect: moveSelected with position
- effect: putRemaining
- effect: shuffleDeck
- effect: bounce
- effect: trash
- effect: play
- effect: returnUnselectedToDeck
- effect: trashFromHand
- effect: setPowerToZero
- effect: setBasePower
- effect: modifyCost
- effect: setBaseCost
- effect: rest
- effect: activate
- effect: removeKeyword
- effect: addDon
- effect: attachDon
- effect: returnDon
- effect: addLife
- effect: damage
- effect: invalidateEffects
- effect: protectFromKO
- effect: cannotBeAttacked
- effect: cannotBeBlockedBy
- effect: choice
- effect: conditional
- effect: forEachMatch
- effect: repeat
- effect: replacement

new fixture-authorable primitives must add schema coverage and validation fixtures in the same story that makes the primitive authorable.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only shared Effect DSL contract, schema fixture, and spec-authorability proof for public DON field-count conditions using the existing `fieldCount` plus `CardFilter` shape. Do not add a new condition primitive. Do not implement engine runtime evaluation, cards parser support, runtime capability matrix entries, generated-support records, support probes, real-card fixtures, source hashes, behavior hashes, overlays, or support manifests.

## Scope

- prove the existing `fieldCount` condition plus `CardFilter` can author a structured public condition for counting a player's DON!! cards on their field
- support `player`, numeric comparator `op`, non-negative numeric `value`, and a DON-card field filter through the existing condition/filter schema
- define the condition scope narrowly as field-visible DON controlled by that player, including cost-area DON and attached DON, excluding DON deck, hidden zones, and off-board zones
- forbid adding a DON-specific condition primitive, free-text condition field, or one-off schema branch
- use structured condition data rather than printed text, card IDs, full-sentence templates, or custom condition strings
- add positive and negative schema/type fixtures for self and opponent DON field-count conditions
- document that this is authorability only and does not imply engine runtime capability, parser certification, generated support, or card playability

## Out of Scope

- engine runtime evaluation
- runtime capability matrix updates
- cards parser/generated-support behavior
- real-card fixtures, source hashes, behavior hashes, overlays, support manifests, or cards-produced manifests
- DON deck counts, private-zone predicates, arbitrary zone-count conditions, or hidden-information queries

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

- fixtures/effect-dsl/**
- stories/generated/SUP-001*.yaml
- stories/approved/SUP-001*.yaml
- agent-packets/SUP-001A.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- generate and activate the SUP-001A packet before implementation
- stay within allowed touch points
- do not add engine runtime behavior or cards generated-support behavior
- do not add a new DON-specific condition primitive when existing `fieldCount` plus `CardFilter` authority is sufficient
- fail closed if the condition cannot be represented as structured public DSL data
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- story-review for SUP-001A before approval handoff
- positive schema fixture for a public DON field-count condition
- positive contract/schema tests for self/opponent DON field-count conditions
- negative schema fixtures for malformed comparator, negative value, unsupported scope, and custom/free-text shortcuts
- regression asserting the schema uses existing `fieldCount` plus `CardFilter` authority rather than a new DON-specific condition primitive
- run `corepack pnpm run contracts:validate-effects`
- run `corepack pnpm run test:contracts`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- Effect DSL schema fixtures prove self and opponent public DON field-count conditions can be represented with `fieldCount`, CardFilter-based DON field scope, and `eq`, `gte`, and `lte` comparators
- malformed comparator values, negative count thresholds, hidden/private zone scopes, and free-text/custom condition shortcuts reject through schema/type tests
- tests prove no new DON-specific condition primitive or custom condition-string escape hatch is introduced
- documentation names the supported scope and explicitly excludes DON deck/private/off-board counts
- tests or fixtures prove schema-valid DSL remains authorability-only and does not claim runtime support or card playability
