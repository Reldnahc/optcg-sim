# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: CARD-002A
Epic ID: CARD-002
Title: Document cards-produced manifest adoption policy
Type: implementation
Area: docs
Primary Concern: docs

## Why

Document the repo policy that cards-produced MatchCardManifest fixtures are the default local integration surface for engine, CLI, hidden-info, and future effect-runtime work while engine-core consumes only plain manifest data.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 04-effect-runtime.s002 (Overview)

The effect runtime executes effect definitions against the authoritative game state.

```text
Effect definitions        Runtime                 Engine core
DSL + custom handlers --> queue/choices/events --> atomic state mutations
```

The runtime must preserve timing, hidden information, source-presence rules, replacement effects, and deterministic replay.

**v6 contract:** queue entries, decisions, replacement state, and continuous-effect records are defined in [`contracts/canonical-types.ts`](contracts/canonical-types.ts). The algorithms below are normative when they are more precise than older snippets.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

### 06-visibility-security.s002 (Security principle)

The server holds `GameState`. Clients receive filtered views. A raw `GameState` must never leave the match server except for trusted internal debugging, persistence, or completed replay storage.

```ts
filterStateForPlayer(state, playerId) -> PlayerView
filterStateForSpectator(state, spectatorPolicy) -> SpectatorView
filterStateForReplay(state) -> ReplayView
```

If a field is not explicitly allowed in a view, it is hidden.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s012 (Deck validation)

Deck validation resolves and validates against Poneglyph IDs, Poneglyph legality records, and simulator support metadata. Poneglyph is the canonical external source for format/card legality inputs such as legal status, bans, and copy limits; the simulator may only layer unsupported-card policy or platform-specific constraints on top.

```ts
interface DeckValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: DeckValidationError[];
  warnings: DeckValidationWarning[];
  resolvedCards: ResolvedDeckCard[];
  versions: {
    cardDataVersion: string;
    effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
    overlayVersion: string;
    banlistVersion: string;
  };
}
```

Validation checks:

- Leader count and leader identity.
- Main deck size.
- DON!! deck size.
- Leader/color restrictions.
- Per-card copy limits by Poneglyph base `cardId`.
- Official format restrictions.
- Simulator-specific bans.
- Unsupported-card status.
- Variant IDs resolve to valid Poneglyph variants for the base card.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s002 (Purpose)

This document tightens the `@optcg/cards` implementation against the provided Poneglyph OpenAPI contract and real card payload examples. The original simulator plan says Poneglyph is the source of truth for printed card text, stats, images, variants, and metadata. This document makes that actionable without giving Poneglyph gameplay authority.

The engine never calls Poneglyph during effect resolution. `@optcg/cards` resolves Poneglyph data, validates it, normalizes it, merges simulator overlays, and produces a match-time manifest.

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s007 (Normalized card shape)

`@optcg/cards` should normalize Poneglyph records into an engine-safe `ResolvedCard`. Keep the original payload available for audit/debug, but the engine should read the normalized shape.

A critical rule for deck validation: `ResolvedCard.legality` is populated from Poneglyph and is the canonical external legality record the platform validates against. Queue eligibility, unsupported-card rejection, or platform-specific safety blocks may add stricter checks, but they must not invent a separate base legality source.

```ts
interface ResolvedCard {
  cardId: CardId; // from card_number, e.g. "OP05-091"
  language: string;
  name: string;
  category: CardCategory;
  set: string;
  block?: string;
  released: boolean;
  releasedAt?: string;
  rarity?: string;
  colors: Color[];
  cost?: number;
  power?: number;
  counter?: number;
  life?: number;
  attributes: Attribute[];
  types: string[];
  effectText?: string;
  triggerText?: string;
  printedKeywords: Keyword[];
  variants: ResolvedCardVariant[];
  legality: Record<string, PoneglyphLegalityRecord>;
  officialFaq: PoneglyphOfficialFaq[];
  errata: NormalizedErrata[];
  sourceTextHash: string;
  behaviorHash: string;
  support: CardImplementationRecord;
}
```

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s011 (Adapter API)

```ts
interface PoneglyphClient {
  getCard(
    cardNumber: CardId,
    options?: { lang?: string },
  ): Promise<PoneglyphCardDetail>;
  getCardsBatch(
    cardNumbers: CardId[],
    options?: { lang?: string },
  ): Promise<{
    data: Record<string, PoneglyphCardDetail>;
    missing: string[];
  }>;
  searchCards(query: PoneglyphSearchQuery): Promise<PoneglyphSearchResult>;
  getPlainText(
    cardNumber: CardId,
    options?: { lang?: string },
  ): Promise<string>;
}

interface CardRepository {
  resolveCard(
    cardId: CardId,
    options?: ResolveCardOptions,
  ): Promise<ResolvedCard>;
  resolveCards(
    cardIds: CardId[],
    options?: ResolveCardOptions,
  ): Promise<ResolvedCard[]>;
  buildMatchManifest(decklists: Decklist[]): Promise<MatchCardManifest>;
}
```

Batch resolution must chunk at 60 card numbers and preserve caller order in the returned manifest.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Each package must expose consistent task names where applicable:

- `build`
- `typecheck`
- `lint`
- `test`
- `test:watch`
- `coverage`

Integration-heavy packages may additionally expose:

- `test:integration`
- `test:replay`
- `test:contracts`
- `test:hidden-info`

At the root, the workspace must provide:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm coverage
pnpm verify
```

`pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command and must run the same core checks as the main merge CI pipeline.

### 24-story-schema.s016 (`spec_refs`)

List of exact spec section references that authorize the story. These references are mandatory. In v6, `spec_refs` should use stable `SECTION_REF` identifiers such as `07-match-server-protocol.s010 (Timers)` instead of renderer-specific heading anchors. The story must not ask the agent to invent uncited behavior.

### 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s015 (Recommended completion checks for story-driven implementation)

A story should not be marked done unless:

- code behavior matches the cited spec,
- required tests are present and pass,
- repo verification passes,
- the patch stays within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points or the story is updated and re-approved first,
- no prohibited scope creep is introduced,
- any new ambiguity is surfaced explicitly.

After a story is marked done, it should not remain under `stories/approved/`, should not retain an active packet, and should not remain listed in `agent-packets/active.json`. The parent agent owns this cleanup because story state and packet authority are orchestration concerns, not worker or reviewer subagent concerns. Repos should provide a single command for normal single-story completion and a multi-story command for parent-story integration cleanup so story movement, packet removal, and manifest cleanup cannot drift independently. Multi-story cleanup tooling must fail closed when manifest or packet evidence for any listed story is missing or stale.

For parent-story integration branches, substories may remain approved after their substory PRs merge into the parent integration branch because the authoritative merge to `main` has not happened yet. This exception is valid only when the user explicitly approved parent-level human review for the decomposed story group, every substory PR has CI and reviewer-subagent review records, and the final parent PR receives full-story integration review plus human review before merge to `main`.

During that parent-branch window, `agent-packets/active.json` remains a single-story handoff pointer for the currently active or most recently active substory packet. It should not be read as the inventory of unfinished substories. Substories merged only into the parent integration branch stay approved and keep their packet files until the parent PR lands on `main`, even when they no longer appear in `active.json`.

Before human review is requested on a parent PR, the PR body or a handoff comment should be updated from future-tense review plans to completed-gate evidence: included substory PRs, full-story AI review record, revision response, CI result, repo verification result, remaining human-review requirement, and the post-merge `packets:complete-many` cleanup plan.

A commit that contains only the exact file changes produced by the packet completion command is a generated lifecycle cleanup and does not need a separate reviewer-subagent pass. Run the repo verification command before pushing that cleanup. If cleanup requires any manual edit beyond the command output, including edits to packet files, `agent-packets/active.json`, tooling, tests, fixtures, specs, workflow docs, or story files, it is no longer pure generated cleanup and should receive the normal reviewer-subagent pass before push or merge.

Post-merge cleanup metadata is a reviewed cleanup request, not standalone
authority to mutate story state. Cleanup automation must bind the requested
cleanup to reviewed pull-request evidence, the merge state, trusted checked-in
approved story files, current packet evidence, and, for parent cleanup, included
substory evidence before packet completion runs. It must fail closed when
cleanup metadata is absent, malformed, stale, unbound to reviewed evidence, or
names a story that is not eligible for completion.

The cleanup workflow must check out trusted `main` or default-branch code, not
unreviewed pull-request branch code. A direct cleanup commit may be pushed only
by the dedicated cleanup actor after packet-completion output is proven exact
and repo-approved verification passes. The automation must not open a cleanup
pull request. Manual fallback is only for operational failure, not the normal
path. Branch deletion may run only after packet lifecycle cleanup succeeds and
only for associated merged, unprotected story or substory branches.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own documentation and workflow guidance for card-manifest adoption only. Do not add fixtures, package code, CLI behavior, hidden-info behavior, or gameplay semantics in this story.

## Scope

- document that @optcg/cards may produce manifests and @optcg/engine-core consumes only plain MatchCardManifest data
- document that engine actions must not fetch live Poneglyph or call @optcg/cards
- document that root integration tests may import @optcg/cards and @optcg/engine-core together
- document that engine package tests may load plain JSON or data fixtures but must not import @optcg/cards
- document that CLI tests may load local fixture manifests but must not require live Poneglyph or Redis
- document that synthetic one-off manifests require a story or PR explanation when the representative fixture is insufficient

## Out of Scope

- creating or changing the representative manifest fixture
- changing package exports
- changing engine-core, CLI, hidden-info, server, client, or UI behavior
- changing gameplay semantics or effect primitives

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- docs/**
- docs/workflow/**
- stories/generated/CARD-002A-document-cards-produced-manifest-adoption-policy.yaml
- stories/approved/CARD-002A-document-cards-produced-manifest-adoption-policy.yaml
- agent-packets/CARD-002A.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- keep this story documentation-only except for required story and packet files
- do not create implementation fixtures or tests in this story
- do not mention roadmap milestone names in the title or scope
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

## Required Tests

- documentation link or markdown lint check if the repo has one
- `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- full `corepack pnpm verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- card-manifest adoption policy is documented in a durable repo location
- docs make the @optcg/cards producer and @optcg/engine-core consumer boundary explicit
- docs define when root integration tests may combine @optcg/cards and @optcg/engine-core
- docs define the synthetic one-off manifest exception and required justification

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
