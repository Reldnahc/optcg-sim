# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: CARD-002F
Epic ID: CARD-002
Title: Add cards-backed PlayerView hidden-info regression
Type: implementation
Area: security
Primary Concern: visibility

## Why

Add hidden-info regression coverage proving PlayerView output from a cards-backed manifest state does not expose full MatchCardManifest data, opponent hidden card identities, deck order, face-down Life identity, private effect registry internals, or private decision candidates.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s021 (Invariant hooks)

Run invariants after every accepted action and after every effect resolution in tests/dev.

Required invariants:

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertZoneOwnershipIsValid(state);
assertAttachedDonExistsAndBelongsToController(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertNoNegativeZoneCounts(state);
assertPendingDecisionHasLegalResponses(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesHaveValidSourcesOrPolicies(state);
assertHiddenInfoNotPresentInPlayerViews(state);
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s017 (Transient reveal and selection sets)

Transient sets are part of effect execution context, not normal zones. They exist for patterns such as revealing the top card, selecting from a revealed set, and returning unselected cards face-down.

Rules:

1. A transient set has an origin, visibility, and cleanup policy.
2. Cards in a transient set are not simultaneously in hand/deck/trash/life.
3. Movement from a transient set to a real zone must emit a `cardMoved` event with appropriate visibility.
4. If an effect exits early, cleanup policy runs before the queue continues.
5. Opponent views may see a revealed card only for the duration and visibility specified by the effect. If the card returns face-down to a hidden zone, future opponent views must not retain its ID.

### 06-visibility-security.s002 (Security principle)

The server holds `GameState`. Clients receive filtered views. A raw `GameState` must never leave the match server except for trusted internal debugging, persistence, or completed replay storage.

```ts
filterStateForPlayer(state, playerId) -> PlayerView
filterStateForSpectator(state, spectatorPolicy) -> SpectatorView
filterStateForReplay(state) -> ReplayView
```

If a field is not explicitly allowed in a view, it is hidden.

### 06-visibility-security.s004 (PlayerView shape)

```ts
interface PlayerView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  self: VisiblePlayerState;
  opponent: OpponentVisibleState;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PublicDecision;
  legalActions: PublicLegalAction[];
  revealedCards: PublicRevealRecord[];
  events: EngineEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Do not include:

- Deck order.
- Opponent hand card IDs.
- Face-down life card IDs.
- RNG seed/internal state.
- Effect queue internals.
- Private decision candidates not visible to recipient.
- Internal crash/recovery metadata.

Canonical public support DTOs for the initial live view contract:

```ts
type SpectatorPolicy = {
  mode: "disabled" | "live-filtered";
  allowHandRevealAfterGame: boolean;
};

interface PublicTurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}

interface PublicBattleState {
  attacker: CardRef;
  originalTarget: CardRef;
  currentTarget: CardRef;
  blocker?: CardRef;
  step: BattleStep;
  damageCount: number;
}

interface PublicCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  attachedDonCount: number;
  turnPlayed?: number;
}

interface PublicLifeView {
  count: number;
  faceUpCards: PublicCardView[];
}

interface VisiblePlayerState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  hand: PublicCardView[];
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

interface OpponentVisibleState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  handCount: number;
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

type SpectatorVisiblePlayerState = OpponentVisibleState;

interface PublicDecision {
  id: DecisionId;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

type PublicLegalAction =
  | { type: "playCard"; card: CardRef; costPaymentRequired?: boolean }
  | { type: "activateEffect"; source: CardRef; effectId: EffectId }
  | { type: "attachDon"; don: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; card: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "respondToDecision"; decisionId: DecisionId };

interface PublicRevealRecord {
  id: string;
  cards: CardRef[];
  visibility: "public" | "privateToRecipient";
  origin: ZoneRef | "topOfDeck" | "lifeDamage" | "custom";
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  cleanupPolicy: "returnToOrigin" | "trashAfterResolution" | "none";
}

type SpectatorRevealRecord = Omit<PublicRevealRecord, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: "public";
};

type SpectatorEvent = Omit<EngineEvent, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: { type: "public" };
};
```

Initial live-filtered spectator view is distinct from `PlayerView`:

```ts
interface SpectatorView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  spectatorPolicy: SpectatorPolicy;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, SpectatorVisiblePlayerState>;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  revealedCards: SpectatorRevealRecord[];
  events: SpectatorEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Initial `SpectatorView` has no `pendingDecision` or `legalActions` field.
It does not include either player's hand card IDs, deck order, face-down life
card IDs, private reveal records, non-public events, RNG state, effect queue
internals, or audit entries. Full-information live spectating is deferred to a
future explicit policy story.

### 06-visibility-security.s017 (Filter checklist)

Before any state leaves the server:

```ts
assertNoDeckContents(view);
assertNoOpponentHandContents(view);
assertNoFaceDownLifeContents(view);
assertNoRngState(view);
assertNoEffectQueueInternals(view);
assertNoPrivateDecisionCandidates(view);
assertRevealRecordsAreRecipientFiltered(view);
assertLegalActionsDoNotLeakOpponentHiddenInfo(view);
assertSpectatorPolicyApplied(view);
```

Run these in tests for every `PlayerView` fixture.

### 06-visibility-security.s021 (Original state-filtering categories preserved)

The mechanical spec separated visibility into multiple view categories. The implementation should keep separate filters rather than one generic serializer.

| View                   | Purpose                      | Hidden-info policy                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PlayerView`           | Active player UI             | Own hand visible; opponent hidden zones counted only.                              |
| `SpectatorView`        | Spectator UI                 | Initial `live-filtered` mode shows public board/zones and hidden-zone counts only. |
| `ReplayView`           | Completed replay             | Can show full state after match completion, subject to replay visibility policy.   |
| Temporary reveal view  | Resolving effects            | Shows only currently revealed cards to allowed recipients.                         |
| Battle-specific view   | Attack/block/counter windows | Shows battle context without leaking opponent counters unless revealed.            |
| Effect-resolution view | Search/look/choice prompts   | Private candidates visible only to choosing player unless effect says reveal.      |

### 18-acceptance-tests.s004 (Milestone 2 - first effect runtime)

```text
M2-001 On Play draw queues and resolves
M2-002 When Attacking effect resolves before defender On Opponent Attack window
M2-003 blocker redirects attack and emits blockerActivated
M2-004 counter character grants battle power until end of battle
M2-005 counter event is trashed and effect resolves
M2-006 On K.O. activates on field and resolves from trash or last known info
M2-007 life Trigger resolves from no zone then moves to trash unless replaced
M2-008 simultaneous triggers controlled by same player require order decision
M2-009 turn player effect A, opponent effect B, new turn-player effect C resolves A-B-C
M2-010 damage-processing triggers wait until all damage points complete
M2-011 continuous +1000 modifier does not mutate base state
M2-012 replacement effect applies once per process
M2-013 optional effect creates chooseOptionalActivation decision
M2-014 target selection respects visibility and legal candidates
M2-015 unsupported non-vanilla card is rejected outside dev sandbox
M2-016 once-per-turn failed cost does not consume use
M2-017 once-per-turn committed effect that later fizzles still consumes use
M2-018 defender on-opponent-attack effects resolve before ordinary counter actions
M2-019 post-counter missing attacker or target skips Damage Step
M2-020 replacement choice uses chooseReplacement decision and logs replacementApplied
M2-021 replacement cannot apply twice to same process
M2-022 transient revealed card returned face-down is removed from opponent view
```

### 18-acceptance-tests.s009 (Global invariants)

Run these after every accepted action and every decision resume:

```text
G-001 every card instance is in exactly one zone or attached to exactly one legal host
G-002 no duplicate instance IDs exist
G-003 each player has at most five Characters
G-004 each player has at most one Stage
G-005 each player has exactly one Leader
G-006 attached DON!! belongs to same player as host unless a future ruling says otherwise
G-007 public zones contain public card IDs in PlayerView
G-008 hidden zones are represented by counts only in opponent PlayerView
G-009 RNG state never appears in any client view
G-010 effect queue internals never appear in any client view
G-011 canonical state serializes and hashes deterministically
G-012 continuous effects are recomputed without growing duplicate modifiers
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own hidden-info regression tests for cards-backed manifests only. Do not change gameplay semantics, server protocol, client rendering, UI, replay fixtures, or card adapter behavior except for narrow test fixture use.

## Scope

- create a cards-backed state using the representative manifest fixture or plain data derived from it
- assert PlayerView does not expose the full MatchCardManifest
- assert opponent hand and deck identity/order remain hidden
- assert face-down Life identity remains hidden from the opponent
- assert private effect registry internals and private decision candidates are not exposed
- keep any root integration import of @optcg/cards outside engine-core package tests
- do not edit production filter or shared type contracts in this story unless exact per-story review records a blocker and the story is revised before approval

## Out of Scope

- client rendering
- server protocol or WebSocket payload changes
- replay fixture rewrite
- new hidden-info filtering semantics beyond regression coverage
- gameplay effect implementation
- engine-core imports from @optcg/cards

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- tests/hidden-info/**
- tests/integration/**
- fixtures/hidden-info/**
- stories/generated/CARD-002F-cards-backed-playerview-hidden-info-regression.yaml
- stories/approved/CARD-002F-cards-backed-playerview-hidden-info-regression.yaml
- agent-packets/CARD-002F.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- fail closed on hidden-information ambiguity
- do not expose raw GameState or manifest internals in PlayerView
- do not import @optcg/cards from engine-core package tests
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

## Required Tests

- cards-backed PlayerView hidden-info regression
- `corepack pnpm run test:hidden-info`
- full `corepack pnpm verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- hidden-info regression uses cards-backed manifest data
- PlayerView output excludes full manifest and hidden card identities
- regression covers private effect registry internals and private decision candidates when present in current contracts

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
