## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

Generic composed execution is represented by a resumable effect execution frame. The frame is runtime context for one resolving effect and is not a client-facing object. It must track at least the queue entry, effect block, current effect path, next segment index, saved result references, segment results, transient selection sets, and pending-decision continuation.

When a sequence segment pauses for a `PendingDecision`, the runtime stores the frame and returns the pending decision with the same causality context. After a valid response, resolution resumes from the stored frame at the paused segment rather than restarting earlier segments. Completed earlier segments must not be re-applied, and their saved result references and segment results remain available for later connector decisions.

### 04-effect-runtime.s012 (Player choices during effect resolution)

Effects pause through `PendingDecision`.

Example target selection flow:

```ts
function executeKoEffect(
  state: GameState,
  effect: KoEffect,
  context: EffectContext,
): EngineResult {
  const candidates = resolveTargetCandidates(state, effect.target, context);

  if (requiresChoice(effect.target)) {
    return pauseForDecision(state, {
      type: "selectTargets",
      playerId: resolveChooser(effect.target, context),
      request: effect.target,
      candidates,
      causedBy: context.causedBy,
    });
  }

  return koTargets(state, candidates.selected, context);
}
```

Decision responses are validated by the engine, not the client.

Composed execution records one segment result for every attempted sequence segment or optional clause. A segment result must record `attempted`, `succeeded`, `changedState`, `selectedCards`, `selectedTargets`, `paidCost`, and `playerDeclined`. `succeeded` means the segment legally performed its required instruction, while `changedState` separately records whether canonical state changed. Legal selection without mutation may still drive connectors such as "if you do" when card text depends on choosing or identifying an object.

Saved-result references may bind selected cards, selected targets, paid costs, or produced objects for later text such as `that Character`. A later segment may use a saved-result reference only while the referenced object remains legal for that later instruction; otherwise the later segment follows its connector and failure policy. Saved references must preserve hidden-information visibility and replay determinism.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s013 (Sequence connector semantics)

`Effect.type = "sequence"` uses explicit segment connectors. This avoids ambiguity in card text such as "Then", "If you do", and "If possible".

```ts
interface SequencedEffect {
  id?: string;
  effect: Effect;
  connector:
    | "always"
    | "then"
    | "ifPreviousSucceeded"
    | "ifYouDo"
    | "ifPossible";
  saveResultAs?: string;
}
```

Connector behavior:

| Connector             | Runtime behavior                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `always`              | Run this segment regardless of the previous segment result.                                                                          |
| `then`                | Run after the previous segment; if the previous segment was impossible, continue only when card text says to do as much as possible. |
| `ifPreviousSucceeded` | Run only if the previous segment changed game state or made a legal selection.                                                       |
| `ifYouDo`             | Run only if the player chose/performed the previous optional instruction.                                                            |
| `ifPossible`          | Attempt the segment if there is a legal way to perform it; no error if there is not.                                                 |

A segment result must record at least:

```text
attempted
succeeded
changedState
selectedCards
selectedTargets
paidCost
playerDeclined
```

Those fields drive later connector decisions and replay determinism. Runtime frame, pause/resume, saved-reference, and failure-policy behavior for composed execution is authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s010`, `04-effect-runtime.s012`, and `04-effect-runtime.s016`.

Saved references include `saveResultAs`, `SelectionSetId`, and `SelectionId`. A saved reference is contract-defined here, but generated support may rely on it only when schema validation, parser certification, and runtime capability evidence all cover the reference lifetime, visibility, and later-use legality.

Optionality must preserve optional activation, optional cost, and optional effect clause distinctions. These boundaries are part of generated-support capability evidence because a parser that recognizes optional text still cannot make the effect playable unless the runtime can resume and record the correct optional segment result.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s026 (Transient reveal and selection primitives)

```ts
type SelectionSetId = string;
type SelectionId = string;

type Effect =
  | {
      type: "revealTop";
      player: PlayerRef;
      count: number;
      saveAs: SelectionSetId;
      visibility: Visibility;
    }
  | {
      type: "selectFromSet";
      set: SelectionSetId;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
      min: number;
      max: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      saveAs: SelectionId;
    }
  | {
      type: "selectCards";
      zone: Zone;
      player: PlayerRef;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
      min: number;
      max: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      saveAs: SelectionId;
      visibility: Visibility;
    }
  | {
      type: "playSelected";
      selection: SelectionId;
      enterRested?: boolean;
      ignoreCost?: boolean;
    }
  | {
      type: "returnUnselectedToDeck";
      set: SelectionSetId;
      player: PlayerRef;
      position: "top" | "bottom";
      order: "original" | "ownerChoice" | "random";
      faceDown: boolean;
    }
  | {
      type: "moveSelected";
      selection: SelectionId;
      from: Zone | SelectionSetId;
      to: Zone;
    };
```

These are not UI concepts. They are deterministic effect-runtime concepts. They let the runtime represent "reveal top card, maybe play it, otherwise return it face-down" without losing hidden-information boundaries.

`playSelected` is planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage and runtime capability evidence exist. Generated support may not treat a parsed play-from-selection instruction as playable unless the parser covers the complete selection/play/return flow and the runtime capability matrix covers the resulting decision, hidden-information, forced-trash, and zone-movement behavior.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s027 (Effect-play options)

Effects that say "play" without requiring cost payment should use:

```ts
{ type: 'playSelected', selection: '...', enterRested: true, ignoreCost: true }
```

The play still obeys rule-processing constraints such as character-area capacity and stage replacement. If the character area is full, the engine must create the forced-trash decision before completing the play.

### 22-v6-implementation-tightening.s007 (3. DSL schema)

The canonical schema is `contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json`.

Key decisions:

- `CardFilter.costOp` and `CardFilter.costValue` are deprecated.
- Use `CardFilter.cost: { op, value }` or `CardFilter.cost: { min, max }`.
- `CardFilter.type`, `typeIncludes`, and `typeIncludesAny` are merged into `typesAny` and `typesAll`.
- `CardFilter.color` and `colorIncludes` are merged into `colorsAny` and `colorsAll`.
- `CardFilter.attribute` is merged into `attributesAny` and `attributesAll`.
- `moveSelected` has one signature: `{ type: "moveSelected", selection, from, to, position? }`.
- Transient reveal/selection primitives are canonical runtime concepts, not UI concepts.
- `sequence.effects[]` uses explicit connector semantics.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only contracts, exported types, and contract tests for externally visible or runtime-needed sequence result metadata and saved reference shapes. Do not implement runtime frame behavior.

## Scope

- define segment result metadata contract for attempted, succeeded, changedState, selectedCards, selectedTargets, paidCost, and playerDeclined
- define saved selection/result reference shapes for later sequence steps that refer to the same object
- add exported type and contract tests for saved references and segment result metadata
- update export ownership/cohesion coverage for any new package exports

## Out of Scope

- execution context implementation, frame stacks, pause/resume behavior, or event emission
- card parser or generated-support behavior
- replacement generalization
- server, client, API, UI, replay, database, or gameplay behavior

## Allowed Touch Points

## Constraints

- keep result metadata minimal and contract-driven
- do not expose hidden card identity through public DTOs
- fail closed on visibility or replay ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- focused contract/type tests for sequence result metadata and saved-reference shapes
- negative contract/type tests for malformed saved-reference and segment-result shapes
- focused export ownership/cohesion tests if new package exports are added
- run `corepack pnpm run types:sync:check`
- run `corepack pnpm run test:contracts`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- sequence result metadata and saved-reference contracts are canonical and exported
- tests cover valid saved-reference and result-metadata shapes
- tests prove malformed, unsupported, or ambiguous saved-reference and segment-result shapes reject
- no runtime behavior is implemented
