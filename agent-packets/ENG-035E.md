# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-035E
Epic ID: KICK-001
Title: Split unsupported action fail-closed tests
Type: refactor
Area: engine
Primary Concern: verification

## Why

Move unsupported and illegal action fail-closed tests into a focused suite without changing error behavior, mutation safety, unsupported combat metadata filtering, or legal-action projection behavior.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s015 (Legal actions)

`getLegalActions()` should return actions valid for the current game state and current pending decision.

```ts
function getLegalActions(state: GameState, playerId: PlayerId): LegalAction[] {
  if (state.pendingDecision) {
    return legalResponsesForDecision(state.pendingDecision, playerId, state);
  }

  return legalPhaseActions(state, playerId);
}
```

Legal actions sent to a client must not leak hidden information. For example, the opponent should not receive an action list that implies exactly which hidden counter cards exist.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s017 (Canonical decision routing)

All player choices are represented as `PendingDecision` and answered by exactly one action shape:

```ts
{
  type: ("respondToDecision", decisionId, response);
}
```

The engine validates the response against the current pending decision. The client never gets to submit raw target IDs or payment choices outside the active decision context.

The following decision families are implementation-required for Milestones 1-2:

```text
mulligan
chooseTriggerOrder
chooseOptionalActivation
payCost
selectTargets
selectCards
chooseEffectOption
confirmTriggerFromLife
chooseReplacement
orderCards
chooseCharacterToTrashForOverflow
```

Decision IDs are single-use. A response for an old decision ID is stale unless it is an exact idempotent retry already accepted by the match server.

### 06-visibility-security.s007 (Legal-action visibility)

Legal actions can leak hidden information. The view should expose only what that recipient is entitled to know.

Examples:

- The defender should not see exactly why the server auto-passed the counter window.
- A player may see their own legal counter cards.
- The opponent sees only that the game progressed, not whether no counters existed or auto-pass was enabled.

### 11-testing-quality.s007 (Interaction tests)

Representative interactions:

```text
tests/interactions/
  blocker-plus-unblockable.test.ts
  double-attack-plus-banish.test.ts
  replacement-on-ko.test.ts
  simultaneous-ko-triggers.test.ts
  on-ko-source-presence.test.ts
  trigger-during-damage-defers.test.ts
  event-activates-effect-after-resolution.test.ts
  negative-power-stays-on-field.test.ts
  negative-cost-clamps-to-zero.test.ts
```

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

A pull request must not merge unless the main CI pipeline passes.

Minimum required merge gates:

1. install dependencies with locked versions,
2. build/typecheck workspace,
3. lint workspace,
4. run tests,
5. validate contracts and schemas,
6. validate formatting,
7. publish coverage artifact,
8. fail if generated artifacts or snapshots are stale when the repo defines them.

Recommended CI jobs:

- `quality` -> lint, typecheck, format check
- `engine` -> engine unit, interaction, invariant, replay tests
- `contracts` -> canonical types, DSL schema, fixture normalization, SQL/schema validation
- `client-server-smoke` -> protocol smoke tests and filtered-view checks

For protected branches, require at least one human review plus passing CI.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only behavior-preserving test organization for illegal action rejection and unsupported combat metadata fail-closed coverage currently in actions.test.ts.

## Scope

- move existing illegal action rejection and no-mutation assertions into actions-fail-closed.test.ts
- move existing unsupported implemented-dsl combat metadata declareAttack and blocker-response omission assertions into actions-fail-closed.test.ts
- preserve every assertion, fixture setup, error reason, legal-action omission, and mutation-safety expectation

## Out of Scope

- changing illegal action validation or error shapes
- changing combat metadata support filtering
- changing getLegalActions or applyAction behavior
- changing production engine, server, client, replay, or CLI code

## Allowed Touch Points

- packages/engine-core/src/actions.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/action-dispatcher-test-support.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/actions-fail-closed.test.ts

- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-035E packet while implementing this story
- target the ENG-035 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- this is a behavior-preserving test organization story; if production changes appear necessary, stop and split or record an ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/actions-fail-closed.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/actions-general.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/actions-pending-decision.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/actions-runtime-work.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/actions-battle-projection.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- actions-fail-closed.test.ts covers the existing illegal action mutation-safety and unsupported combat metadata omission scenarios
- actions.test.ts has no remaining assertions and is removed or contains only a justified minimal compatibility shim
- no production dispatcher, legal-action, battle, hidden-information, server, client, replay, or CLI behavior changes
- focused action dispatcher tests, coverage, and full verify pass

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
