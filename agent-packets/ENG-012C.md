## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s003 (Rule-processing checkpoints)

Run rule processing after every atomic state change, not only after player actions.

```ts
function afterAtomicMutation(result: EngineStepResult): EngineStepResult {
  const checked = checkRuleProcessing(result.state);
  return { ...result, state: checked };
}
```

Rule processing checks:

- Leader damage when that player has 0 life.
- Deck-out at a rule-processing checkpoint.
- Effect-created win/loss conditions.
- Simultaneous loss resulting in draw.
- Invariant violations in development/test mode.

Concession is immediate and cannot be replaced or prevented.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s004 (Engine result)

Every engine call returns a result object rather than only the new state.

```ts
interface EngineResult {
  state: GameState;
  events: EngineEvent[];
  decisions?: PendingDecision[];
  errors?: EngineError[];
  stateHash: string;
}
```

For normal play there should be at most one active `pendingDecision` at a time. Tests may use arrays to inspect internal generated decisions.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s006 (Event visibility)

Events may contain hidden data. Filter them before sending to clients.

```ts
type EventVisibility =
  | { type: "public" }
  | { type: "private"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "hidden" }
  | { type: "replayOnly" };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s018 (Canonical event visibility)

Each `EngineEvent` has one visibility policy:

```text
public          safe for both players immediately
private         visible only to listed player IDs
replayOnly      hidden during live play but available in completed full replay
serverOnly      never leaves trusted server/runtime logs
```

Visibility is independent of replay determinism. Replay artifacts may store information that was never sent to either player during the live match.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s021 (Invariant hooks)

Run invariants after every accepted action and after every effect resolution in tests/dev.

Required invariants:

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertZoneOwnershipIsValid(state);
assertAttachedDonExistsAndBelongsToController(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertNoNegativeZoneCounts(state);
assertPendingDecisionHasLegalResponses(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesHaveValidSourcesOrPolicies(state);
assertHiddenInfoNotPresentInPlayerViews(state);
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s023 (Error handling inside the engine)

Engine errors are classified.

```ts
type EngineError =
  | { type: "illegalAction"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invalidDecisionResponse"; reason: string }
  | { type: "invariantViolation"; invariant: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "unsupportedCard"; cardId: CardId; status: CardSupportStatus }
  | { type: "effectRuntimeError"; effectId: string; details: unknown }
  | { type: "loopDetected"; signature: LoopSignature };
```

Illegal player actions are rejected and logged. Invariant violations and effect runtime errors freeze or recover the match according to the recovery policy.

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s029 (Schema coverage policy)

`contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` is the executable JSON fixture contract.
TypeScript/spec primitives outside that JSON schema are planned/not
fixture-authorable until schema validation and fixtures exist.

Schema-supported fixture subset:

- trigger: onPlay
- trigger: whenAttacking
- trigger: onOpponentAttack
- trigger: onBlock
- trigger: onKO
- trigger: endOfYourTurn
- trigger: endOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: trigger
- trigger: activateMain
- trigger: main
- trigger: counter
- trigger: permanent
- trigger: startOfGame
- trigger: startOfYourTurn
- trigger: startOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: startOfMainPhase
- trigger: endOfBattle
- trigger: donAttach
- trigger: custom
- condition: yourTurn
- condition: attachedDonCount
- cost: restDon
- cost: restSelf
- cost: sequence
- target: self, myLeader, opponentLeader, attacker, attackTarget, blocker,
  triggerCard, all, choose
- duration: thisAction, thisBattle, thisTurn, whileSourceOnField, permanent
- effect: draw
- effect: ko
- effect: modifyPower
- effect: sequence
- effect: custom
- card filters: cardIds, names, nameContains, nameNot, categories, colorsAny,
  colorsAll, typesAny, typesAll, attributesAny, attributesAll, cost, power,
  counter, hasKeywords, lacksKeywords, state, owner, controller, excludeSelf,
  custom

Planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage exists:

- condition: donCount
- condition: opponentTurn
- condition: lifeCount
- condition: fieldCount
- condition: handCount
- condition: trashCount
- condition: hasCardInZone
- condition: attackTarget
- condition: cardState
- condition: sourceStillInZone
- condition: eventPayload
- condition: and, or, not, custom
- cost: returnDon
- cost: trashFromHand
- cost: trashSelf
- cost: trashFromField
- cost: discard
- cost: chooseOne
- cost: custom
- duration: untilEndOfTurn
- duration: untilStartOfNextTurn
- duration: whileConditionTrue
- effect: drawUpTo
- effect: search
- effect: lookAtTop
- effect: revealFromZone
- effect: revealTop
- effect: selectFromSet
- effect: selectCards
- effect: moveSelected with position
- effect: putRemaining
- effect: shuffleDeck
- effect: bounce
- effect: trash
- effect: play
- effect: playSelected
- effect: returnUnselectedToDeck
- effect: trashFromHand
- effect: setPowerToZero

- effect: cannotAttack
- effect: cannotBlock
- effect: cannotBeAttacked
- effect: cannotBeBlockedBy
- effect: choice
- effect: conditional
- effect: forEachMatch
- effect: repeat
- effect: replacement

new fixture-authorable primitives must add schema coverage and validation fixtures in the same story that makes the primitive authorable.

### 06-visibility-security.s003 (Player zone visibility)

| Zone           | Self view                        | Opponent view                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Deck           | Count only                       | Count only                       |

| No Zone        | Only if revealed to that player  | Only if revealed to that player  |

### 06-visibility-security.s006 (Effect event visibility)

The game log can leak information if not filtered.

```ts
interface EffectEvent {
  id: string;
  sourceCardId: CardId;
  sourceInstanceId?: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  description: string;
  choices?: PublicChoiceSummary;
  visibleTo: "both" | PlayerId[] | "replayOnly";
}
```

Examples:

- Public target selection: visible to both.
- Searching deck: opponent sees "Opponent is searching deck" and maybe count, not card IDs.
- Choosing a card from hand to trash: opponent sees the resulting public trash card, not pre-choice hand options.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only direct execution of a supported no-choice `draw` primitive against a resolved effect context. Stop before trigger detection, queue processing, sequences, choices, target selection, Event effects, or play-card integration.

## Scope

- execute `{ type: "draw", count, player }` for no-choice player refs resolvable from effect context
- move drawn cards from deck top to hand in deterministic order
- emit public `cardDrawn`/content-safe movement events and private card-detail movement events consistent with existing draw/life movement visibility patterns
- support draw count `0` as a no-op effect resolution
- fail closed for unsupported player refs, negative counts, non-integer counts, drawUpTo, sequence, choice, target, and custom effects by returning deterministic content-safe `effectRuntimeError` diagnostics without mutation or events

## Out of Scope

- trigger detection from draw events
- queue entry dequeue/mark-resolved/cancel behavior
- pending decisions
- replacement effects for draw
- optional effects
- target selection
- play-card integration

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/effect-runtime.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/action-results.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/action-state.ts

## Constraints

- do not implement replacement, trigger, or choice behavior in this story
- fail closed on hidden-information ambiguity
- keep engine-core deterministic and pure
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- unit test for drawing one card from deck top to hand with deterministic state/event output
- unit test for drawing multiple cards in deck order
- unit test proving public events do not reveal drawn card identity while private events do
- unit test for draw count zero no-op behavior
- unit test proving empty-deck draw primitive behavior does not itself own rule-processing defeat
- unit tests proving unsupported effect shapes fail closed with deterministic content-safe `effectRuntimeError` diagnostics and without mutation or events
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck` must pass
- `corepack pnpm run verify` must pass

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- draw primitive mutates only the drawing player's deck/hand and emits deterministic events
- drawn card identity is private to the drawing player and not leaked in public event payloads
- drawing from an empty deck leaves deck-out handling to the queue-processing rule-processing checkpoint owner
- unsupported effect shapes fail closed with deterministic content-safe `effectRuntimeError` diagnostics and without mutation or events

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
