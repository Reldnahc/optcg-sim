## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s008 (Targets)

Use `TargetRequest` when a player may choose and `Target` for source-relative automatic targets.

```ts
type Target =
  | { type: "self" }
  | { type: "myLeader" }
  | { type: "opponentLeader" }
  | { type: "attacker" }
  | { type: "attackTarget" }
  | { type: "blocker" }
  | { type: "triggerCard" }
  | { type: "all"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter?: CardFilter }
  | { type: "choose"; request: TargetRequest };

interface TargetRequest {
  timing: "onActivation" | "onResolution";
  chooser: PlayerRef;
  zone: Zone;
  player: PlayerRef;
  filter?: CardFilter;
  min: number;
  max: number;
  allowFewerIfUnavailable: boolean;
  visibility?: "public" | "privateToChooser";
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s013 (Sequence connector semantics)

`Effect.type = "sequence"` uses explicit segment connectors. This avoids ambiguity in card text such as "Then", "If you do", and "If possible".

```ts
interface SequencedEffect {
  id?: string;
  effect: Effect;
  connector:
    | "always"
    | "then"
    | "ifPreviousSucceeded"
    | "ifYouDo"
    | "ifPossible";
  saveResultAs?: string;
}
```

Connector behavior:

| Connector             | Runtime behavior                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `always`              | Run this segment regardless of the previous segment result.                                                                          |
| `then`                | Run after the previous segment; if the previous segment was impossible, continue only when card text says to do as much as possible. |
| `ifPreviousSucceeded` | Run only if the previous segment changed game state or made a legal selection.                                                       |
| `ifYouDo`             | Run only if the player chose/performed the previous optional instruction.                                                            |
| `ifPossible`          | Attempt the segment if there is a legal way to perform it; no error if there is not.                                                 |

A segment result must record at least:

```text
attempted
succeeded
changedState
selectedCards
selectedTargets
paidCost
playerDeclined
```

Those fields drive later connector decisions and replay determinism. Runtime frame, pause/resume, saved-reference, and failure-policy behavior for composed execution is authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s010`, `04-effect-runtime.s012`, and `04-effect-runtime.s016`.

Saved references include `saveResultAs`, `SelectionSetId`, and `SelectionId`. A saved reference is contract-defined here, but generated support may rely on it only when schema validation, parser certification, and runtime capability evidence all cover the reference lifetime, visibility, and later-use legality.

A saved field-object reference is a same-frame saved-reference family for later text such as "that Character". The supported field-object families are `selectedTargets` and `producedObjects`; `selectedCards`, `paidCost`, `SelectionSetId`, `SelectionId`, and saved hand-selection references are separate families and are not field-object target references. A segment with `saveResultAs` may expose `selectedTargets` when it legally selected field objects through a target request, and may expose `producedObjects` when a supported runtime story later creates or moves a public field object and records that object as produced by the segment.

A later segment consumes a saved field-object reference with `{ type: "savedFieldObject", binding: { family: "selectedTargets" | "producedObjects", saveResultAs, objectIndex?, sourceSegmentId? }, zone, player, controller?, filter?, visibility: "publicOnly", onFailure: "failClosed" }`. The reference is valid only inside the same effect execution frame, only for the named `saveResultAs` ledger entry, and only while the referenced object remains a public legal object for the later instruction. unsupported saved-reference families fail closed. stale objects, gone objects, hidden objects, and illegal objects fail closed. Public events, public legal actions, PlayerView, and SpectatorView must not reveal hidden identities or the private saved-reference failure reason. State hashes include the frame saved-reference ledger and the failed segment result so replay, event order, and connector decisions remain deterministic.

Optionality must preserve optional activation, optional cost, and optional effect clause distinctions. These boundaries are part of generated-support capability evidence because a parser that recognizes optional text still cannot make the effect playable unless the runtime can resume and record the correct optional segment result.

Optional cost clauses inside composed sequence execution use a sequence segment
whose effect is `{ type: "payCost"; cost: OptionalCost }`. The optionality flag
lives on the nested `OptionalCost`; `SequencedEffect.optional` remains reserved
for optional effect clauses and must not be used to represent optional cost
decline. Runtime decline for that segment uses the `PayCostDecision` and
`PaymentDeclinedResponse` contract from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s012`
and `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`.
Optional cost decline uses the active `PayCostDecision` and a
`PaymentDeclinedResponse` payload.

`ifYouDo` after an optional cost runs only when the previous cost segment
recorded `paidCost: true`. A declined or failed optional cost segment does not
run dependent `ifYouDo` segments. Segment-result, event-order, state-hash, and
once-per-turn timing for optional cost accept, decline, and failure are
authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s011` and `04-effect-runtime.s012`.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s021 (Example: permanent power buff)

```json
{
  "cardId": "OP01-001",
  "implementationStatus": "implemented-dsl",
  "effects": [
    {
      "id": "OP01-001:permanent-1",
      "category": "permanent",
      "trigger": { "type": "permanent" },
      "condition": {
        "type": "and",
        "conditions": [
          { "type": "donCount", "target": { "type": "self" }, "min": 1 },
          { "type": "yourTurn" }
        ]
      },
      "sourcePresencePolicy": "mustRemainInSameZone",
      "effect": {
        "type": "modifyPower",
        "target": {
          "type": "all",
          "zone": "characterArea",
          "player": "self",
          "filter": { "typesAny": ["Straw Hat Crew"] }
        },
        "value": 1000,
        "duration": { "type": "whileSourceOnField" }
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "sourceTextHash": "sha256:...",
    "rulesVersion": "2026-01-16",
    "effectDefinitionsVersion": "0.1.0",
    "tested": true
  }
}
```

The runtime should convert this into a `ContinuousEffectRecord`/modifier and apply it through `computeView()`.

When a duration-bearing effect uses a chosen target and later needs exact-card continuous-effect target binding, the runtime must resolve the saved field-object reference once and create a modifier target using the canonical `TargetSpec` shape `{ type: "exactCard"; card: CardRef; binding: SavedFieldObjectTargetBinding; createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq }`. The chosen target does not re-run the original `choose` target during computed-view recalculation. The modifier remains bound to the same card instance until its duration expires or the exact card is no longer a legal public object for that modifier.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s022 (Poneglyph text-to-DSL pipeline)

The effect-system plan supports three authoring paths:

1. Manual DSL definitions written by developers.
2. Custom TypeScript handlers for cards that cannot be expressed in DSL.
3. Generated DSL from Poneglyph printed card text when certified parser rules produce a complete parse and runtime capability checks pass.

Support ladder:

1. `contract-defined`: a primitive or behavior is described by the Markdown spec or canonical TypeScript contract.
2. `schema-authorable`: `contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` can validate JSON fixtures for that primitive.
3. `runtime-executable`: the current runtime capability matrix proves the engine can execute the primitive, including decisions, visibility, replay, failure policy, and pause/resume behavior.
4. `parser-certified`: reviewed parser rules produce a complete parse for the relevant printed text shape.
5. `generated-support playable`: a generated support record may enable normal play only when the parse is complete and every parsed component has current runtime capability evidence.

Schema authorability alone is insufficient for generated-support playable status. Generated support requires runtime capability evidence and complete parser support; schema validation only proves a JSON shape can be authored.

Generated definitions must never be deployed blindly. A new parser rule, ambiguous parse class, custom handler binding, or wording/ruling ambiguity requires review before it can certify support. Once a parser rule is certified, matching complete-parse cards may be generated without a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map for that common template.

A complete parse covers all gameplay-relevant printed text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement or optionality semantics, and ruling/errata inputs that affect behavior. Multiple parsed effects compose into one generated `EffectDefinition`. Partial parse output may be reported for coverage progress, but it must not make the card playable in normal modes.

Bandai or Poneglyph wording drift must invalidate the affected parse/hash evidence or downgrade support until parser and support evidence are updated. If any parsed component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing runtime capability evidence, the generated definition fails closed instead of partially enabling the card.

```ts
interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  source: "poneglyph";
  sourceTextHash: string;
  generatedBy?: "manual" | "rule-parser" | "llm-assisted";
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewedAt?: string;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s026 (Transient reveal and selection primitives)

```ts
type SelectionSetId = string;
type SelectionId = string;

type Effect =
  | {
      type: "revealTop";
      player: PlayerRef;
      count: number;
      saveAs: SelectionSetId;
      visibility: Visibility;
    }
  | {
      type: "selectFromSet";
      set: SelectionSetId;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
      min: number;
      max: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      saveAs: SelectionId;
    }
  | {
      type: "selectCards";
      zone: Zone;
      player: PlayerRef;
      chooser: PlayerRef;
      min: number;
      max: number;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      saveAs: SelectionId;
      visibility: Visibility;
    }
  | {
      type: "selectTargets";
      request: {
        timing: "onActivation" | "onResolution";
        chooser: PlayerRef;
        zone: "leaderArea" | "characterArea" | "stageArea" | "costArea";
        player: PlayerRef;
        min: number;
        max: number;
        allowFewerIfUnavailable: boolean;
        filter?: CardFilter;
        visibility: "public";
      };
    }
  | {
      type: "playSelected";
      selection: SelectionId;
      enterRested?: boolean;
      ignoreCost?: boolean;
    }
  | {
      type: "returnUnselectedToDeck";
      set: SelectionSetId;
      player: PlayerRef;
      position: "top" | "bottom";
      order: "original" | "ownerChoice" | "random";
      faceDown: boolean;
    }
  | {
      type: "moveSelected";
      selection: SelectionId;
      from: Zone | SelectionSetId;
      to: Zone;
    };
```

These are not UI concepts. They are deterministic effect-runtime concepts. They let the runtime represent "reveal top card, maybe play it, otherwise return it face-down" without losing hidden-information boundaries.

`selectTargets` is the non-mutating selectedTargets producer contract for same-frame saved field-object references. When a later segment consumes `{ family: "selectedTargets", saveResultAs, ... }`, the producer segment must be `selectTargets` with segment `saveResultAs`; mutating target effects do not act as standalone selectedTargets producer authority.

`playSelected` is planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage and runtime capability evidence exist. Generated support may not treat a parsed play-from-selection instruction as playable unless the parser covers the complete selection/play/return flow and the runtime capability matrix covers the resulting decision, hidden-information, forced-trash, and zone-movement behavior.

`playSelected` may consume only an authorized saved hand selection produced by the same supported effect execution frame. At playSelected resolution time, the selected card must still be in that player's hand and must still be legal to play under the current rules and the playSelected options. A stale, non-hand, no-longer-legal, or unsupported saved-reference family fails closed.

A fail-closed stale playSelected segment does not emit `cardPlayed` or hand-to-field `cardMoved` events, records the failed segment as attempted, not succeeded, and not changedState, and then follows the active connector and failure policy. Public events, public legal actions, PlayerView, and SpectatorView must not reveal hidden hand card IDs, private candidates, or unsupported saved-reference details. Replay and private effect logs may retain the internal saved-reference failure reason for audit and deterministic replay.

Event `seq` values and `state.seq` advancement remain deterministic for stale playSelected failures under `03-game-state-events-decisions.s005` and `03-game-state-events-decisions.s022`. State hashes must include the unchanged hand and board state after the failed segment. Golden replay coverage for stale playSelected failures must pin the final state hash.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s029 (Schema coverage policy)

`contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` is the executable JSON fixture contract.
TypeScript/spec primitives outside that JSON schema are planned/not
fixture-authorable until schema validation and fixtures exist.
This list is the fixture-authorability boundary, not generated playable support.
Schema authorability alone does not imply runtime-executable,
parser-certified, or generated-support playable status. New TYP schema stories
may move primitives into the schema-supported fixture subset only when they also
add schema coverage and validation fixtures; generated playable support still
requires complete parser support and runtime capability evidence.

Schema-supported fixture subset:

- trigger: onPlay
- trigger: whenAttacking
- trigger: onOpponentAttack
- trigger: onBlock
- trigger: onKO
- trigger: endOfYourTurn
- trigger: endOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: trigger
- trigger: activateMain
- trigger: main
- trigger: counter
- trigger: permanent
- trigger: startOfGame
- trigger: startOfYourTurn
- trigger: startOfOpponentTurn
- trigger: startOfMainPhase
- trigger: endOfBattle
- trigger: donAttach
- trigger: custom
- condition: yourTurn
- condition: attachedDonCount
- condition: fieldCount
- cost: restDon
- cost: returnDon
- cost: restSelf
- cost: sequence
- target: self, myLeader, opponentLeader, attacker, attackTarget, blocker,
  triggerCard, all, choose, savedFieldObject
- duration: thisAction
- duration: thisBattle
- duration: thisTurn

- duration: permanent
- effect: draw

  colorsAll, typesAny, typesAll, attributesAny, attributesAll, cost, power,
  counter, hasKeywords, lacksKeywords, state, owner, controller, excludeSelf,
  custom

Planned/not fixture-authorable until schema coverage exists:

- condition: donCount
- condition: opponentTurn
- condition: lifeCount
- condition: handCount
- condition: trashCount
- condition: hasCardInZone
- condition: attackTarget
- condition: cardState
- condition: sourceStillInZone

- duration: whileConditionTrue
- effect: search
- effect: lookAtTop
- effect: revealFromZone
- effect: revealTop
- effect: selectFromSet
- effect: moveSelected with position
- effect: putRemaining
- effect: shuffleDeck
- effect: bounce
- effect: trash
- effect: play
- effect: returnUnselectedToDeck
- effect: trashFromHand
- effect: setPowerToZero
- effect: setBasePower
- effect: modifyCost

- effect: addLife
- effect: damage
- effect: invalidateEffects
- effect: protectFromKO
- effect: cannotBeAttacked
- effect: cannotBeBlockedBy
- effect: choice
- effect: conditional
- effect: forEachMatch
- effect: repeat
- effect: replacement

new fixture-authorable primitives must add schema coverage and validation fixtures in the same story that makes the primitive authorable.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  generatedSupportId?: string;
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted. For common templates, implementation may come from a generated support index entry instead of a manual per-card overlay when the complete parse, parser certification, and runtime capability checks all pass.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s012 (Deck validation)

Deck validation resolves and validates against Poneglyph IDs, Poneglyph legality records, and simulator support metadata. Poneglyph is the canonical external source for format/card legality inputs such as legal status, bans, and copy limits; the simulator may only layer unsupported-card policy or platform-specific constraints on top.

Generated support index output is simulator support metadata. Deck validation may treat a generated record as `implemented-dsl` or `implemented-custom` only when the record has complete parse evidence, current source/behavior hashes, certified parser-rule evidence, and a runtime capability matrix result proving every component is supported.

```ts
interface DeckValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: DeckValidationError[];
  warnings: DeckValidationWarning[];
  resolvedCards: ResolvedDeckCard[];
  versions: {
    cardDataVersion: string;
    effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
    overlayVersion: string;
    banlistVersion: string;
  };
}
```

Validation checks:

- Leader count and leader identity.
- Main deck size.
- DON!! deck size.
- Leader/color restrictions.
- Per-card copy limits by Poneglyph base `cardId`.
- Official format restrictions.
- Simulator-specific bans.
- Unsupported-card status.
- Variant IDs resolve to valid Poneglyph variants for the base card.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s014 (Canonical Poneglyph normalization)

The Poneglyph adapter emits `ResolvedCard` from `contracts/canonical-types.ts`. Important normalization rules:

- `attribute` values become `attributes: Attribute[]`; never collapse to a singular attribute.
- `color` values become `colors: CardColor[]`; multi-color cards preserve all colors.
- `variants[].index` becomes `variantIndex`.
- `variantKey = `${cardId}:v${variantIndex}``.
- Missing market prices, product set codes, or image URLs are allowed display gaps and must not fail gameplay resolution.
- Search endpoint DTOs are never accepted as manifest card details. Only detail/batch card payloads can become `ResolvedCard`.
- `sourceTextHash` covers printed effect/trigger text used for implementation drift.
- `behaviorHash` covers stats, type line, effect, trigger, official FAQ, errata, and any source field that can alter behavior.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s015 (Poneglyph text hash and stale-card review)

Every supported card stores a hash of its Poneglyph printed text and, when generated support is used, a behavior hash or parser-evidence hash for the complete parsed behavior.

When the Poneglyph text changes:

1. Mark the card implementation as stale.
2. Fail CI if a stale card remains marked `tested` without review.
3. Prevent ranked use if the changed text affects card behavior.
4. Require parser/support evidence to be updated before generated support may remain playable.
5. Require a reviewer to update the source hash after verifying any DSL/custom handler or certified parser-rule evidence that remains authoritative.

This catches errata, typo fixes that affect parsing, and Poneglyph schema/text changes.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 11-testing-quality.s016 (Coverage gates)

Suggested early gates:

- 90%+ line coverage in `engine-core` for functions excluding generated card data.
- 100% of implemented non-vanilla cards have at least one test.
- 100% of custom handlers have direct tests.
- 0 stale source text hashes in ranked card pool.
- 0 unsupported cards allowed in ranked validation fixtures.
- 0 queue-eligible ranked formats missing ladder configuration.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only packages/cards parser helper structure, parser-result metadata, and regression tests needed to preserve current behavior while enabling future exact-template composed parser stories. Do not add broad new playable support.

## Scope

- introduce reusable cards-package helpers for existing supported trigger wrapper parsing
- introduce reusable cards-package helpers for once-per-turn wrapper parsing
- introduce exact numeric count parsing helpers with existing positive safe-integer guardrails
- introduce sequence segment construction helpers for generated DSL assembly
- introduce deterministic parser rule ID helpers
- introduce residue span helpers and complete/partial parse reporting helpers
- preserve existing CARD-008, CARD-009, CARD-012, and CARD-013 behavior without expectation changes unless the story explicitly records a mechanical migration

## Out of Scope

- broad new playable support
- new runtime capability records beyond those already added by CARD-014A
- real-card fixture capture or manifest regeneration
- engine runtime behavior
- shared contracts or effect DSL schema changes
- replacement generalization

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/cards/src/certified-card-text-parser.ts
- packages/cards/src/certified-card-text-parser.test.ts
- packages/cards/src/generated-support-index.ts
- packages/cards/src/generated-support-index.test.ts
- packages/cards/src/generated-support-report.test.ts
- packages/cards/src/support-evaluator.ts
- packages/cards/src/support-evaluator.test.ts
- packages/cards/src/support-probe.test.ts

- stories/generated/CARD-014*.yaml
- stories/approved/CARD-014*.yaml
- agent-packets/CARD-014B.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- generate and activate the CARD-014B packet before implementation
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- do not broaden parser grammar or generated playability in this scaffold story
- keep helper types package-local to packages/cards unless story-review proves shared contract authority is missing
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- exact candidate story-review before approval
- parser helper unit tests for existing supported trigger wrapper parsing without adding new trigger grammar
- parser helper unit tests for once-per-turn wrapper parsing
- parser helper unit tests for exact numeric count parsing and malformed counts
- parser helper unit tests for sequence segment construction preserving connector order and generated DSL shape
- parser helper unit tests for deterministic parser rule IDs and residue spans
- parser helper unit tests for complete and partial parse reporting, including unsupported whole text and parsed-with-residue cases
- generated-support index/evaluator regressions proving missing runtime capability and missing parser-rule evidence still block support after the refactor
- regression tests for existing CARD-008, CARD-009, CARD-012, and CARD-013 generated-support examples, including near-miss, unsupported wrapper/order, residue, and unchanged support-status cases
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/cards test`
- full `corepack pnpm verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- parser helper boundaries are reusable by later CARD-014 children
- parser rule IDs remain deterministic
- complete and partial parse reporting remains fail-closed for residue
- sequence segment construction helpers preserve connector order and generated DSL shape
- generated-support index and evaluator capability checks still block missing runtime capability and missing parser-rule evidence after the refactor
- existing CARD-008, CARD-009, CARD-012, and CARD-013 behavior remains unchanged
- no newly supported real-card or synthetic composed effect appears solely because of the scaffold

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
