| Banlist / restrictions  | Poneglyph legality data plus simulator overlay/format service | Poneglyph is the source of truth for per-format card legality status and copy-limit inputs; simulator overlays add unsupported-card policy and any platform-local enforcement. |

Leader metadata conditions in the Effect DSL read only public Leader metadata
from this resolved card authority. Leader color count, type, and attribute
checks must not query hidden or private zones, and type/attribute checks use the
existing public Leader Area `hasCardInZone` plus `CardFilter` representation.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s014 (Canonical Poneglyph normalization)

The Poneglyph adapter emits `ResolvedCard` from `contracts/canonical-types.ts`. Important normalization rules:

- `attribute` values become `attributes: Attribute[]`; never collapse to a singular attribute.
- `color` values become `colors: CardColor[]`; multi-color cards preserve all colors.
- `variants[].index` becomes `variantIndex`.
- `variantKey = `${cardId}:v${variantIndex}``.
- Missing market prices, product set codes, or image URLs are allowed display gaps and must not fail gameplay resolution.
- Search endpoint DTOs are never accepted as manifest card details. Only detail/batch card payloads can become `ResolvedCard`.
- `sourceTextHash` covers printed effect/trigger text used for implementation drift.
- `behaviorHash` covers stats, type line, effect, trigger, official FAQ, errata, and any source field that can alter behavior.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s024 (Source hash and behavior hash)

Use both hashes:

```ts
interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId;
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // effect + trigger text only
  behaviorHash: string; // stats + type line + effect + trigger + FAQ + errata
  notes?: string;
}
```

`OP01-060` demonstrates why `behaviorHash` matters: the FAQ clarifies that an unplayed revealed card returns to the top of the deck face-down. A change to that FAQ would affect hidden-information behavior even if the printed effect text did not change.

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s006 (Raw Poneglyph detail shape)

`GET /v1/cards/{card_number}` and batch detail entries share the same important shape:

```ts
interface PoneglyphCardDetail {
  card_number: string;
  name: string;
  language: string;
  set: string;
  set_name: string;
  released_at: string | null;
  released: boolean;
  card_type: string; // "Leader", "Character", "Event", "Stage", "DON!!", etc.
  rarity: string | null;
  color: string[];
  cost: number | null;
  power: number | null;
  counter: number | null;
  life: number | null;
  attribute: string[] | null;
  types: string[];
  effect: string | null;
  trigger: string | null;
  block: string | null;
  variants: PoneglyphVariant[];
  legality: Record<string, PoneglyphLegalityRecord>;
  available_languages: string[];
  official_faq: PoneglyphOfficialFaq[];
}

interface PoneglyphVariant {
  index: number;
  name: string | null;
  label: string | null;
  artist: string | null;
  product: {
    id: string | null;
    slug: string | null;
    name: string | null;
    set_code: string | null;
    released_at: string | null;
  };
  images: {
    stock: { full: string | null; thumb: string | null };
    scan: { display: string | null; full: string | null; thumb: string | null };
  };
  errata: PoneglyphErrata[];
  market: {
    tcgplayer_url: string | null;
    market_price: string | null;
    low_price: string | null;
    mid_price: string | null;
    high_price: string | null;
  };
}

interface PoneglyphErrata {
  date: string;
  label: string | null;
  before_text: string | null;
  after_text: string | null;
  images?: {
    source?: string | null;
    scan?: {
      display: string | null;
      full: string | null;
      thumb: string | null;
    };
  };
}

interface PoneglyphLegalityRecord {
  status: string;
  banned_at?: string;
  reason?: string;
  max_copies?: number;
  paired_with?: string[];
}

interface PoneglyphOfficialFaq {
  question: string;
  answer: string;
  updated_on: string; // ISO date
}
```

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s007 (Normalized card shape)

`@optcg/cards` should normalize Poneglyph records into an engine-safe `ResolvedCard`. Keep the original payload available for audit/debug, but the engine should read the normalized shape.

A critical rule for deck validation: `ResolvedCard.legality` is populated from Poneglyph and is the canonical external legality record the platform validates against. Queue eligibility, unsupported-card rejection, or platform-specific safety blocks may add stricter checks, but they must not invent a separate base legality source.

```ts
interface ResolvedCard {
  cardId: CardId; // from card_number, e.g. "OP05-091"
  language: string;
  name: string;
  category: CardCategory;
  set: string;
  block?: string;
  released: boolean;
  releasedAt?: string;
  rarity?: string;
  colors: Color[];
  cost?: number;
  power?: number;
  counter?: number;
  life?: number;
  attributes: Attribute[];
  types: string[];
  effectText?: string;
  triggerText?: string;
  printedKeywords: Keyword[];
  variants: ResolvedCardVariant[];
  legality: Record<string, PoneglyphLegalityRecord>;
  officialFaq: PoneglyphOfficialFaq[];
  errata: NormalizedErrata[];
  sourceTextHash: string;
  behaviorHash: string;
  support: CardImplementationRecord;
}
```

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s009 (Behavior hash vs source-text hash)

Use two hashes:

```ts
sourceTextHash = sha256(normalized(effect + "\n" + trigger));
behaviorHash = sha256(
  canonicalJson({
    card_number,
    name,
    card_type,
    color,
    cost,
    power,
    counter,
    life,
    attribute,
    types,
    effect,
    trigger,
    official_faq,
    variant_errata_after_text,
  }),
);
```

`sourceTextHash` is useful for effect-authoring drift. `behaviorHash` is better for implementation review because rulings, FAQ answers, errata, stats, and type lines can change behavior even if the printed effect text does not.

### 18-acceptance-tests.s011 (v3 Poneglyph adapter acceptance tests)

```text
PON-001 OpenAPI fixture parses as JSON and exposes /v1/cards/{card_number}, /v1/cards/batch, /v1/search, /v1/cards/{card_number}/text, /v1/formats.
PON-002 Poneglyph detail Zod schema accepts OP01-060 and OP05-091 fixtures.
PON-003 Batch resolver chunks unique card IDs into requests of <=60 IDs.
PON-004 Batch resolver fails match creation if any requested ID is returned in missing.
PON-005 Search result DTO is rejected as a match-manifest source.
PON-006 OP01-060 variant indexes normalize to OP01-060:v0, OP01-060:v1, OP01-060:v2.
PON-007 OP05-091 variant with null product set_code and null market price normalizes without throwing.
PON-008 sourceTextHash changes when effect or trigger text changes.
PON-009 behaviorHash changes when official_faq, errata, stats, type line, effect, or trigger changes.
PON-010 Unreleased cards are rejected in public modes unless explicitly enabled by format policy.
PON-011 variant_index defaults to 0 and generated variant_key is non-null.
PON-012 search result DTO cannot be used to build MatchCardManifest.
PON-013 attributes and colors normalize as arrays.
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Metadata contract and normalization fix only. Do not add gameplay behavior, generated-support promotion, parser primitives, overlays, support manifests, deck validation policy, source hashes, behavior hashes, or card-specific playability changes.

## Scope

- add `?` as a canonical `Attribute` union member in shared card metadata type projections
- add `?` to the Effect DSL attribute schema enum so `attributesAny` and `attributesAll` can represent the printed question-mark attribute when needed
- update Poneglyph normalization to accept raw attribute `?` and preserve it as canonical `?`
- add regression coverage for normalizing `attribute: ["?"]`
- verify `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/cards support:probe -- --card OP13-079` no longer crashes on the attribute value

## Out of Scope

- gameplay engine behavior or runtime capability changes
- card text parser/generated-support promotion for attribute conditions
- support metadata, overlays, source hashes, behavior hashes, fixture capture, or cards-produced manifest regeneration
- deck validation behavior
- arbitrary unknown attribute fallback; unrecognized values other than `?` must continue to fail closed

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- stories/generated/CARD-024A-question-mark-attribute-metadata.yaml
- stories/approved/CARD-024A-question-mark-attribute-metadata.yaml
- agent-packets/CARD-024A.md
- agent-packets/active.json
- contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json
- contracts/types/card-metadata.ts
- packages/types/src/card-metadata.ts
- packages/types/src/card-metadata.test.ts
- packages/cards/src/normalization.ts
- packages/cards/src/normalization.test.ts
- packages/cards/src/support-probe.test.ts

## Constraints

- do not modify PR #392 or SUP-003 story files as part of this fix
- keep this patch limited to metadata contract and normalization touch points
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- normalization regression for `attribute: ["?"]`
- type/schema regression proving `?` is a valid canonical Attribute and Effect DSL filter attribute
- existing unsupported-attribute fail-closed behavior remains covered or is added if absent
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/cards test -- normalization.test.ts support-probe.test.ts`
- `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/cards support:probe -- --card OP13-079`
- `corepack pnpm run contracts`
- `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- `?` is accepted as a printed attribute value without collapsing or dropping it
- existing known attributes continue to normalize unchanged
- unrecognized non-`?` attributes continue to fail closed
- OP13-079 support probe reaches normal support reporting instead of throwing `Unsupported Poneglyph attribute: ?`
