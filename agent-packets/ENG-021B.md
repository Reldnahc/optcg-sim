## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s020 (Counter Step)

1. Queue defender-side effects that trigger from being attacked or from the opponent's attack timing, such as `[On Your Opponent's Attack]`, before ordinary counter actions.
2. Resolve that timing window.
3. If attacker or current target left its zone or is no longer a legal battle participant, skip to End of Battle.
4. Defender may perform any number of legal counter actions:
   - Trash a Character card with counter value from hand for power.
   - Use a `[Counter]` Event by paying its cost and trashing it.
5. After each counter action and after the defender passes, re-check whether attacker and current target still exist and remain legal battle participants. If not, skip to End of Battle.
6. Proceed to Damage Step only if the attacker and current target are still legal.

The server must avoid timing leaks. If the defender has no legal counter actions and settings allow auto-pass, the window should auto-pass without revealing hidden details.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s022 (End of Battle)

1. Queue/resolve end-of-battle triggers.
2. Expire battle-duration continuous effects.
3. Clear battle context.
4. Return to Main Phase.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s003 (Base state vs. computed view)

Separate base facts from derived values.

Base state stores:

- Which cards are in which zones.
- Active/rested state.
- Attached DON!! cards.
- Turn, phase, battle sub-step.
- Effect durations and source references.
- Pending decisions.

Computed view derives:

- Current power.
- Current cost.
- Granted/removed keywords.
- Attack/block restrictions.
- Protection from K.O. or other processes.
- Replacement candidates.

```ts
interface ComputedGameView {
  seq: StateSeq;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  cards: Record<InstanceId, ComputedCardView>;
  legalAttackTargets: Record<InstanceId, InstanceId[]>;
  restrictions: RestrictionIndex;
}

interface ComputedCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  basePower?: number;
  currentPower?: number;
  baseCost?: number;
  currentCost?: number;
  keywords: Keyword[];
  canAttack: boolean;
  canBlock: boolean;
  cannotBeAttacked: boolean;
  protectedFrom: Protection[];
}
```

Do not persist derived current power as canonical state unless a rule explicitly changes a base value. Recompute from base state and continuous modifiers.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s021 (Invariant hooks)

Run invariants after every accepted action and after every effect resolution in tests/dev.

Required invariants:

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertZoneOwnershipIsValid(state);
assertAttachedDonExistsAndBelongsToController(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertNoNegativeZoneCounts(state);
assertPendingDecisionHasLegalResponses(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesHaveValidSourcesOrPolicies(state);
assertHiddenInfoNotPresentInPlayerViews(state);
```

### 04-effect-runtime.s014 (Continuous effects as computed view)

Continuous and permanent effects do not mutate canonical state on every recalculation. They generate modifiers, and a computed view applies them.

```ts
interface ContinuousEffectRecord {
  id: string;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  controller: PlayerId;
  modifier: Modifier;
  duration: Duration;
  condition?: Condition;
  createdBy: CausalityRef;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

interface Modifier {
  layer: ModifierLayer;
  target: TargetSpec;
  operation: ModifierOperation;
}

type ModifierLayer =
  | "basePowerSet"
  | "baseCostSet"
  | "powerAdd"
  | "costAdd"
  | "keywordAdd"
  | "keywordRemove"
  | "restriction"
  | "protection";
```

Computing a view:

```ts
function computeView(state: GameState): ComputedGameView {
  const base = buildBaseView(state);
  const activeModifiers = collectActiveContinuousEffects(state);
  return applyModifierLayers(base, activeModifiers, state.turn.turnPlayerId);
}
```

Permanent effects may depend on the computed state. If the official rule requires fixed-point behavior, implement the fixed-point over computed views, not by writing current power/cost into canonical state.

### 04-effect-runtime.s015 (Duration expiration)

| Duration               | Expiration point                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `thisBattle`           | End of Battle                                                 |
| `thisTurn`             | End Phase cleanup                                             |
| `untilEndOfTurn`       | End Phase cleanup                                             |
| `untilStartOfNextTurn` | Start of specified player's next Refresh Phase                |
| `whileSourceOnField`   | When source leaves required zone                              |
| `whileConditionTrue`   | Not active when condition false; removed or ignored by policy |
| `permanent`            | Only for true game-permanent changes; avoid for field buffs   |

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only battle-duration expiration inside the centralized End of Battle cleanup path. Treat existing Character Counter battle power as supported battle-duration state, and expire canonical `thisBattle` continuous-effect records when cleanup is invoked. Do not make continuous effects affect combat calculations or implement new card effects.

## Scope

- expire existing Character Counter battle power through battle-context cleanup by ensuring no `counterPower` survives after End of Battle
- remove canonical continuous-effect records with `duration.type: thisBattle` when the centralized cleanup path is invoked
- preserve non-`thisBattle` continuous-effect records unchanged during End of Battle cleanup
- preserve the current fail-closed guard for all active `continuousEffects` during supported battle resolution, including `resolveSupportedVanillaBattle`, Counter pass, Blocker activation, and `useCounter` continuation paths
- exercise `thisBattle` cleanup only when the centralized cleanup helper is legitimately reached by supported battle state or through focused cleanup-helper tests, not by weakening continuous-effect fail-closed behavior before cleanup
- preserve event ordering, state hash stability, and invariant behavior

## Out of Scope

- applying continuous effects to computed combat power, restrictions, protection, keywords, or costs
- creating continuous-effect records from card effects
- authorizing battle resolution that would ignore active unsupported continuous-effect semantics
- new card effects or new effect-runtime DSL primitives
- Life Triggers, On K.O., replacement effects, protection effects, End of Battle trigger resolution, server/client/UI, production replay schema, or CLI behavior

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-021B packet while implementing this story
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify before implementation and review handoff
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- target the ENG-021 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- if implementation requires continuous-effect combat application or new card-effect behavior, split or record the blocker
- implementation-review gate is required after the PR is opened
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- add or update packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts coverage proving Character Counter battle power expires after cleanup
- add focused cleanup-helper coverage proving `thisBattle` continuous-effect records are removed and non-`thisBattle` records are preserved when cleanup is invoked
- add or preserve negative accepted-battle coverage proving active `continuousEffects` still fail closed before supported battle resolution, Counter pass, Blocker, or `useCounter` continuations can ignore them
- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/battle-actions.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- End of Battle cleanup clears battle context and any supported Character Counter `counterPower`
- End of Battle cleanup removes `continuousEffects` entries with `duration.type: thisBattle`
- End of Battle cleanup preserves non-`thisBattle` continuous-effect entries
- current battle resolution still fails closed before cleanup whenever any active `continuousEffects` are present in `resolveSupportedVanillaBattle`, Counter pass, Blocker, or `useCounter` continuation paths
- event ordering, eventJournal suffix equality, invariants, and state hash stability are preserved
