# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-032D
Epic ID: KICK-001
Title: Split vanilla damage tests
Type: refactor
Area: engine
Primary Concern: verification

## Why

Move existing vanilla battle damage and Life movement tests out of battle-damage-banish.test.ts into a focused vanilla damage test file without changing assertions, fixtures, events, state hashes, or behavior.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s006 (Zone transition rules)

When a card moves from field to another zone, it becomes a new card instance. Applied effects are stripped. Instance identity must reset when appropriate.

```ts
interface CardInstance {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  turnPlayed?: number;
  attachedDon?: InstanceId[];
}
```

When multiple cards are placed into a zone simultaneously, the owner chooses their order. If the destination is secret, the opponent must not see the chosen order unless the game rules explicitly reveal it.

When a card with attached DON!! leaves the field, attached DON!! return to the owner's cost area rested.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s007 (Card categories)

| Category  | Field zone               | Has power | Has cost |   Has life |                             Can attack |
| --------- | ------------------------ | --------: | -------: | ---------: | -------------------------------------: |
| Leader    | Leader Area              |       Yes |       No | Setup only |                                    Yes |
| Character | Character Area           |       Yes |      Yes |         No | Yes, subject to turn-played/Rush rules |
| Event     | None after use           |        No |      Yes |         No |                                     No |
| Stage     | Stage Area               |        No |      Yes |         No |                                     No |
| DON!!     | Cost/attached/DON!! deck |        No |       No |         No |                                     No |

### 02-engine-mechanics.s009 (Canonical Life orientation)

Canonical state convention:

```text
player.deck[0] = top of deck
player.life[0] = top of Life area = next Life card taken for damage
```

Life setup must satisfy the official rule that the card that was on top of the deck becomes the bottom card of the Life area.

Implementation algorithm:

```ts
function setupLifeFromDeck(
  player: PlayerState,
  lifeCount: number,
): PlayerState {
  const takenInDeckOrder = player.deck.slice(0, lifeCount); // [A, B, C], A was top of deck
  const remainingDeck = player.deck.slice(lifeCount);
  const lifeTopFirst = [...takenInDeckOrder]
    .reverse()
    .map((card) => ({ card, faceUp: false }));
  return { ...player, deck: remainingDeck, life: lifeTopFirst };
}
```

Damage always takes `player.life[0]`. Effects that add cards to Life must specify `position: "top" | "bottom"`; if a card text does not specify, use the official ruling for that card and add a card-specific test.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s021 (Damage Step)

1. Compute attacker and target power from `ComputedGameView`.
2. If attacker power is lower than target power, no damage/K.O. occurs.
3. If attacker power is equal or greater:
   - Target Leader: deal damage.
   - Target Character: K.O. target.
4. Emit events for damage, life movement, K.O., card movement.
5. Triggered effects during damage wait until damage processing completes.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s023 (Damage processing)

For each point of damage:

1. If player has 0 life, mark defeat condition and run rule processing.
2. Otherwise, take the top life card.
3. If the card has `[Trigger]`, ask whether to reveal and activate it instead of adding it to hand.
4. If trigger is activated, the card is temporarily in no zone while the trigger resolves.
5. After trigger resolution, trash the card unless the trigger or a replacement says otherwise.
6. If trigger is declined or unavailable, add the card to hand hidden.

When damage is greater than 1, repeat this process one point at a time in official order.

`[Banish]` replaces the normal life-to-hand/trigger path by trashing the life card instead.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s035 (Exact win/loss conditions)

Run defeat checks at every rule-processing checkpoint:

1. **Leader damage at 0 Life** - if a player has 0 Life cards and their Leader would take damage, that player loses.
2. **Deck-out** - if a player has 0 cards in deck at any rule-processing checkpoint, that player loses.
3. **Concession** - a player may concede at any time; concession is immediate and cannot be prevented or replaced by card effects.
4. **Effect-based win/loss** - card effects may directly cause a win or loss during effect resolution.
5. **Double loss** - if both players meet defeat conditions at the same rule-processing checkpoint, both lose and the match is a draw.

Rule processing happens after atomic state changes, including mid-effect. For example, if a player decks out while drawing during an effect, the loss is detected at the next rule-processing point.

### 04-effect-runtime.s013 (Replacement effects)

Replacement effects intercept replaceable processes.

```ts
interface ReplacementProcess {
  id: string;
  type: ReplaceableProcessType;
  source?: CardRef;
  target?: CardRef;
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  usedReplacementIds: string[];
}
```

Processing order:

1. Replacements generated by the card/process being replaced, if applicable.
2. Turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.
3. Non-turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.

A replacement cannot apply twice to the same replacement process. If a replacement cannot actually perform its replacement, it does not apply.

```ts
function executeReplaceableProcess(
  state: GameState,
  process: ReplacementProcess,
): EngineStepResult {
  let current = process;
  let currentState = state;

  while (true) {
    const replacements = findApplicableReplacements(currentState, current)
      .filter((r) => !current.usedReplacementIds.includes(r.id))
      .filter((r) => canApplyReplacement(r, currentState, current));

    if (replacements.length === 0) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    const choice = chooseReplacementByPriorityOrDecision(
      currentState,
      replacements,
      current,
    );

    if (choice.pausedForDecision) {
      return choice.result;
    }

    if (!choice.chosen) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    current = {
      ...transformProcessByReplacement(choice.chosen, currentState, current),
      usedReplacementIds: [...current.usedReplacementIds, choice.chosen.id],
    };

    currentState = emitReplacementApplied(
      currentState,
      choice.chosen,
      current,
    ).state;
  }
}
```

Replacement decisions use `PendingDecision.chooseReplacement`. Optional replacements may be declined; mandatory replacements cannot be declined unless more than one mandatory replacement requires a controller-chosen order. A replacement cannot apply twice to the same `process.id`, even if the process is transformed into a new shape.

Every applied replacement emits `replacementApplied` with the original process ID, selected replacement ID, old process payload hash, and transformed process payload hash. This event is at least `replayOnly` and may be public when the replacement effect is public.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 06-visibility-security.s004 (PlayerView shape)

```ts
interface PlayerView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  self: VisiblePlayerState;
  opponent: OpponentVisibleState;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PublicDecision;
  legalActions: PublicLegalAction[];
  revealedCards: PublicRevealRecord[];
  events: EngineEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Do not include:

- Deck order.
- Opponent hand card IDs.
- Face-down life card IDs.
- RNG seed/internal state.
- Effect queue internals.
- Private decision candidates not visible to recipient.
- Internal crash/recovery metadata.

Canonical public support DTOs for the initial live view contract:

```ts
type SpectatorPolicy = {
  mode: "disabled" | "live-filtered";
  allowHandRevealAfterGame: boolean;
};

interface PublicTurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}

interface PublicBattleState {
  attacker: CardRef;
  originalTarget: CardRef;
  currentTarget: CardRef;
  blocker?: CardRef;
  step: BattleStep;
  damageCount: number;
}

interface PublicCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  attachedDonCount: number;
  turnPlayed?: number;
}

interface PublicLifeView {
  count: number;
  faceUpCards: PublicCardView[];
}

interface VisiblePlayerState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  hand: PublicCardView[];
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

interface OpponentVisibleState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  handCount: number;
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

type SpectatorVisiblePlayerState = OpponentVisibleState;

interface PublicDecision {
  id: DecisionId;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

type PublicLegalAction =
  | { type: "playCard"; card: CardRef; costPaymentRequired?: boolean }
  | { type: "activateEffect"; source: CardRef; effectId: EffectId }
  | { type: "attachDon"; don: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; card: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "respondToDecision"; decisionId: DecisionId };

interface PublicRevealRecord {
  id: string;
  cards: CardRef[];
  visibility: "public" | "privateToRecipient";
  origin: ZoneRef | "topOfDeck" | "lifeDamage" | "custom";
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  cleanupPolicy: "returnToOrigin" | "trashAfterResolution" | "none";
}

type SpectatorRevealRecord = Omit<PublicRevealRecord, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: "public";
};

type SpectatorEvent = Omit<EngineEvent, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: { type: "public" };
};
```

Initial live-filtered spectator view is distinct from `PlayerView`:

```ts
interface SpectatorView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  spectatorPolicy: SpectatorPolicy;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, SpectatorVisiblePlayerState>;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  revealedCards: SpectatorRevealRecord[];
  events: SpectatorEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Initial `SpectatorView` has no `pendingDecision` or `legalActions` field.
It does not include either player's hand card IDs, deck order, face-down life
card IDs, private reveal records, non-public events, RNG state, effect queue
internals, or audit entries. Full-information live spectating is deferred to a
future explicit policy story.

### 06-visibility-security.s007 (Legal-action visibility)

Legal actions can leak hidden information. The view should expose only what that recipient is entitled to know.

Examples:

- The defender should not see exactly why the server auto-passed the counter window.
- A player may see their own legal counter cards.
- The opponent sees only that the game progressed, not whether no counters existed or auto-pass was enabled.

### 11-testing-quality.s007 (Interaction tests)

Representative interactions:

```text
tests/interactions/
  blocker-plus-unblockable.test.ts
  double-attack-plus-banish.test.ts
  replacement-on-ko.test.ts
  simultaneous-ko-triggers.test.ts

  event-activates-effect-after-resolution.test.ts
  negative-power-stays-on-field.test.ts
  negative-cost-clamps-to-zero.test.ts
```

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

A pull request must not merge unless the main CI pipeline passes.

Minimum required merge gates:

1. install dependencies with locked versions,
2. build/typecheck workspace,
3. lint workspace,
4. run tests,
5. validate contracts and schemas,
6. validate formatting,
7. publish coverage artifact,
8. fail if generated artifacts or snapshots are stale when the repo defines them.

Recommended CI jobs:

- `quality` -> lint, typecheck, format check
- `engine` -> engine unit, interaction, invariant, replay tests
- `contracts` -> canonical types, DSL schema, fixture normalization, SQL/schema validation
- `client-server-smoke` -> protocol smoke tests and filtered-view checks

For protected branches, require at least one human review plus passing CI.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only behavior-preserving test-file organization for non-Banish vanilla damage and Life movement coverage currently in battle-damage-banish.test.ts.

## Scope

- move vanilla supported declareAttack battle resolution coverage from battle-damage-banish.test.ts
- move normal Leader damage, terminal damage, deck-out checkpoint, and life orientation coverage from battle-damage-banish.test.ts
- move public/private non-Banish Life movement event visibility coverage from battle-damage-banish.test.ts
- move vanilla pending-runtime-work and replacement-metadata fail-closed coverage from battle-damage-banish.test.ts
- preserve state hash, event visibility, and mutation expectations

## Out of Scope

- changing production code
- changing damage, Life movement, or event visibility behavior
- moving Banish, Character K.O., On K.O., Life Trigger, Blocker, Counter, attack timing, or pipeline regression tests

## Allowed Touch Points

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-032D packet while implementing this story
- target the ENG-032 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- this is a behavior-preserving test organization story; if a production change appears necessary, stop and split or record an ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/battle-damage-banish.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-damage-vanilla.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- battle-damage-banish.test.ts no longer contains the moved vanilla damage test groups
- battle-damage-vanilla.test.ts covers the same vanilla damage scenarios with behavior-equivalent expectations
- no production files change
- focused tests, coverage, and full verify pass

## Ambiguity Rule
