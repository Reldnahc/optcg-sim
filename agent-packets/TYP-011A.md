# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: TYP-011A
Epic ID: TYP-011
Title: Leader metadata condition contract authority
Type: implementation
Area: contracts
Primary Concern: contract

## Why

Add the missing shared DSL/schema/type authority for public Leader color-count conditions and document that Leader type and Leader attribute checks should use existing public Leader-zone CardFilter predicates where sufficient.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 04-effect-runtime.s004 (Stable effect identity)

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s004 (Effect block)

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string;
  category: "auto" | "activate" | "permanent" | "replacement";
  trigger: Trigger;
  condition?: Condition;
  conditionTiming?: "activation" | "resolution" | "both";
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s006 (Conditions)

```ts
type Condition =
  | { type: "donCount"; target?: Target; min: number }
  | { type: "yourTurn" }
  | { type: "opponentTurn" }
  | { type: "lifeCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "fieldCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "handCount"; player: PlayerRef; op: Comparator; value: number }
  | {
      type: "trashCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      filter?: CardFilter;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "leaderColorCount";
      player: PlayerRef;
      op: Comparator;
      value: number;
    }
  | { type: "hasCardInZone"; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; filter: CardFilter }
  | { type: "attackTarget"; targetType: "leader" | "character" | "any" }
  | { type: "cardState"; target: Target; state: "active" | "rested" }
  | { type: "sourceStillInZone" }
  | { type: "eventPayload"; path: string; op: Comparator; value: unknown }
  | { type: "and"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "or"; conditions: Condition[] }
  | { type: "not"; condition: Condition }
  | { type: "custom"; check: string };

type Comparator = "eq" | "neq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte";
type PlayerRef =
  | "self"
  | "opponent"
  | "turnPlayer"
  | "nonTurnPlayer"
  | "owner"
  | "controller";
```

`leaderColorCount` is a public Leader metadata condition. It reads only the
player's Leader colors from the match manifest or resolved card snapshot, uses a
canonical `PlayerRef` and `Comparator`, and its `value` is a non-negative safe
integer. Printed "multicolored" Leader conditions map to
`{ type: "leaderColorCount", player: "self", op: "gte", value: 2 }`.

Leader type and Leader attribute conditions do not introduce `leaderType` or
`leaderAttribute` predicates. Represent them through the public Leader Area with
`hasCardInZone` and `CardFilter`, for example
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], typesAny: ["Straw Hat Crew"] } }`
or
`{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], attributesAny: ["slash"] } }`.
The schema-supported fixture subset admits only this public Leader-zone metadata
form and does not authorize private-zone metadata queries.

Condition, duration, and restriction primitives outside the schema-supported fixture subset remain planned layers. They are contract-defined by this reference, but they are not fixture-authorable until the schema coverage policy lists them as supported.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s009 (Card filters)

```ts
interface CardFilter {
  cardIds?: CardId[];
  names?: string[];
  nameContains?: string;
  nameNot?: string[];
  categories?: CardCategory[];
  colorsAny?: Color[];
  colorsAll?: Color[];
  typesAny?: string[];
  typesAll?: string[];
  attributesAny?: Attribute[];
  attributesAll?: Attribute[];
  cost?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  power?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  counter?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
  hasKeywords?: Keyword[];
  lacksKeywords?: Keyword[];
  state?: "active" | "rested" | "attached";
  owner?: PlayerRef;
  controller?: PlayerRef;
  excludeSelf?: boolean;
  custom?: string;
}
```

| Banlist / restrictions  | Poneglyph legality data plus simulator overlay/format service | Poneglyph is the source of truth for per-format card legality status and copy-limit inputs; simulator overlays add unsupported-card policy and any platform-local enforcement. |

Leader metadata conditions in the Effect DSL read only public Leader metadata
from this resolved card authority. Leader color count, type, and attribute
checks must not query hidden or private zones, and type/attribute checks use the
existing public Leader Area `hasCardInZone` plus `CardFilter` representation.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only shared contract/spec/schema/type authority for public Leader metadata condition representation. Do not implement engine condition evaluation, card parser support, generated support admission, support diagnostics, or real-card fixture support.

## Scope

- add or refine shared `Condition` contract authority for a public Leader color-count predicate that can represent "your Leader is multicolored" without enumerating color pairs
- suggested DSL shape: `{ type: "leaderColorCount", player: PlayerRef, op: Comparator, value: number }`
- require the predicate to evaluate only public Leader metadata from the match manifest/resolved card snapshot
- define valid `player`, comparator, and non-negative safe-integer `value` constraints
- define that "multicolored" maps to `leaderColorCount` with `op: "gte"` and `value: 2`
- require "your Leader has the {X} type" to use existing public Leader-zone `hasCardInZone` + `CardFilter.typesAny` authority, such as `{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], typesAny: [...] } }`
- require "your Leader has the [X] attribute" to use existing public Leader-zone `hasCardInZone` + `CardFilter.attributesAny` authority, such as `{ type: "hasCardInZone", zone: "leaderArea", player: "self", filter: { categories: ["leader"], attributesAny: [...] } }`
- admit the required `hasCardInZone` Leader-zone type/attribute representation at the effect DSL schema layer as needed for fixtures, without broadening into unrelated private-zone or arbitrary metadata query support
- maintain existing engine fail-closed exhaustiveness for the new shared condition contract only by adding an explicit unsupported branch where the exhaustive condition switch already rejects unsupported conditions
- add positive and negative schema/type fixtures for the admitted public Leader metadata condition shapes
- keep boolean condition composition (`and`, `or`, `not`) as existing authority unless story-review proves a schema gap
- keep card-layer wording normalization out of this story

## Out of Scope

- positive engine runtime evaluation or support for Leader metadata conditions
- parser support for printed conditional text
- generated-support capability records, support indexing, probe/report output, or playable support changes
- real-card fixture support, fixture capture, source hash updates, behavior hash updates, overlays, or support manifests
- private or hidden-zone metadata predicates
- new `leaderType` or `leaderAttribute` condition predicates
- arbitrary card metadata query language beyond the Leader metadata condition authority needed by ENG-058 and CARD-019
- server, client, API, UI, database, replay UI, WebSocket, Redis, or live Poneglyph work

## Constraints

- generate and activate the TYP-011A packet before implementation
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- do not implement runtime/card behavior beyond explicit fail-closed unsupported exhaustiveness maintenance for the new shared condition contract
- do not broaden shared contracts beyond public Leader metadata conditions required for the conditional generated-support chain
- fail closed if Leader type or Leader attribute cannot be represented truthfully with existing filter contracts
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- story-review for TYP-011A before approval handoff
- focused `packages/types` tests for the Leader color-count condition contract
- effect DSL schema fixture validation for valid Leader color-count condition
- effect DSL schema fixture validation for valid Leader type and attribute condition representation, using existing hasCardInZone + CardFilter authority if accepted by story-review
- negative schema/type tests for malformed color-count value, non-safe-integer overflow color-count value, comparator, player, private-zone use, and unsupported Leader metadata condition shape
- export cohesion/ownership tests updated if a new exported contract symbol is introduced
- focused engine-core regression proving `leaderColorCount` remains unsupported and fail-closed in queued condition resolution until a later ENG runtime story adds positive evaluation support
- run `corepack pnpm run types:sync:check`
- run `corepack pnpm run contracts:validate-effects`
- run `corepack pnpm run test:contracts`
- run `corepack pnpm run lint`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- shared contracts can represent "your Leader is multicolored" without enumerating color pairs
- contract guidance clearly states Leader type and Leader attribute conditions are represented through `hasCardInZone` + `CardFilter`, with no new Leader-specific type or attribute predicate
- effect DSL schema accepts the required public Leader-zone `hasCardInZone` + `CardFilter.typesAny` and `attributesAny` representations and rejects unrelated private-zone or unsupported metadata query shapes
- admitted Leader metadata predicates are limited to public Leader metadata and do not expose hidden information
- schema/type tests accept valid Leader color-count and Leader type/attribute condition fixtures and reject malformed comparator, value, player, filter, or zone shapes
- existing engine unsupported-condition handling remains fail-closed for `leaderColorCount` until a later ENG runtime story adds positive evaluation support
- no runtime behavior, card parser support, or generated support admission changes in this story

## Post-Approval Role Sections

### implementation

Responsibilities
- implement only the approved story using packet authority order
- follow strict TypeScript, lint, and verification requirements
- report ambiguity instead of inventing uncited behavior

Forbidden Actions
- do not broaden scope beyond the approved story boundary or allowed_touch_points
- do not add packet extraction behavior unless the approved story explicitly owns it
- do not implement story-author/story-review handoff mechanics

Required Inputs
- active packet content with authoritative spec references
- approved story scope, non-scope, and acceptance criteria
- allowed_touch_points and required test list

Required Outputs
- scoped code and test changes within approved touch points
- verification command results with pass/fail status
- assumptions and blockers note

Verification Checklist
- confirm required inputs are present and current
- confirm forbidden actions are not introduced
- confirm required outputs are produced for handoff

### code-review

Responsibilities
- review correctness, scope fit, and required-test coverage
- verify no forbidden role sections or lifecycle changes were introduced
- confirm canonical packet behavior remains enforceable

Forbidden Actions
- do not author new feature scope outside the reviewed patch
- do not bypass required tests, packet verification, or CI gate evidence
- do not approve scope drift that violates story boundary

Required Inputs
- proposed patch limited to approved touch points
- active packet, approved story, and cited spec references
- verification and test evidence for required commands

Required Outputs
- review findings prioritized by correctness and scope compliance
- clear disposition for findings (fix/defer/block) with rationale
- review closure recommendation for Session Orchestrator handoff

Verification Checklist
- confirm required inputs are present and current
- confirm forbidden actions are not introduced
- confirm required outputs are produced for handoff

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
