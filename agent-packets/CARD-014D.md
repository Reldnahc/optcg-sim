## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

For generated support, the runtime must expose or consume a capability matrix that describes which keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision types, replacement processes, visibility modes, target shapes, costs, and custom handlers are currently executable. A generated card support record may be considered playable only when the card has a complete parse and every parsed component is covered by that current runtime capability matrix.

Multiple parsed effects from one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing capability evidence, the entire generated support record fails closed for normal play instead of partially enabling the card.

Generated composed runtime shapes must fail closed for normal play when the runtime cannot represent the whole composed execution as a supported resumable frame. Unsupported composed shapes include sequence connectors, saved-result references, optionality boundaries, costs, targets, visibility requirements, or pending-decision continuations that the runtime capability matrix does not cover.

### 04-effect-runtime.s010 (Queue processing)

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(
        state,
        entry,
        "source-or-condition-failed",
      );
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, {
      causedBy: {
        type: "effect",
        queueEntryId: entry.id,
        effectId: entry.effectBlock.id,
      },
    });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === "gameOver") {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

Generic composed execution is represented by a resumable effect execution frame stored in `GameState.effectExecutionFrames`. The frame is serialized authoritative runtime context for one resolving effect and is not a client-facing object. It must track at least the queue entry, effect block, current effect path, next segment index, saved result references, segment results, transient selection sets, and pending-decision continuation. Frame records participate in authoritative canonical serialization and state hashes, but filtered player and live spectator views must not expose frame internals.

When a sequence segment pauses for a `PendingDecision`, the runtime stores the frame and returns the pending decision with the same causality context. After a valid response, resolution resumes from the stored frame at the paused segment rather than restarting earlier segments. Completed earlier segments must not be re-applied, and their saved result references and segment results remain available for later connector decisions.

  | { type: "repeat"; count: number; effect: Effect }

  // Replacement/custom
  | { type: "replacement"; when: ReplacementTrigger; instead: Effect }
  | { type: "custom"; handler: string };
```

Cardinality fields such as `min` and `max` use the exact-N and up-to-N semantics from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`. `drawUpTo` is a planned `chooseQuantity`-backed primitive: it must pause through a `chooseQuantity` pending decision, validate the selected whole integer against public min/max bounds, and draw only the chosen amount when a future runtime story makes it executable.

`drawUpTo` short-deck resolution is do-as-much-as-possible. If the chosen quantity is greater than the number of cards remaining in that player's deck, the runtime must draw every remaining card and emit draw and card-movement events only for cards actually drawn. The next rule-processing checkpoint detects deck-out under `02-engine-mechanics.s035`; the effect does not fail closed before drawing the remaining cards solely because the chosen quantity exceeded the remaining deck size.

Event `seq` values for partial-deck drawUpTo resolution must remain strictly increasing by append order, as required by `03-game-state-events-decisions.s005`. The resolved decision increments `state.seq` once under `03-game-state-events-decisions.s022`; individual draw events do not each advance `state.seq`. State hashes at the replay checkpoints include the post-draw empty deck. Golden replay coverage for drawUpTo short-deck cases must pin the final state hash.

Duration and restriction effects such as `cannotAttack`, `cannotBlock`, `cannotBeAttacked`, `cannotBeBlockedBy`, `invalidateEffects`, and `protectFromKO` remain planned unless the schema coverage policy lists them as schema-supported and the runtime capability matrix proves the active engine can enforce the restriction for the full duration.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s013 (Sequence connector semantics)

`Effect.type = "sequence"` uses explicit segment connectors. This avoids ambiguity in card text such as "Then", "If you do", and "If possible".

```ts
interface SequencedEffect {
  id?: string;
  effect: Effect;
  connector:
    | "always"
    | "then"
    | "ifPreviousSucceeded"
    | "ifYouDo"
    | "ifPossible";
  saveResultAs?: string;
}
```

Connector behavior:

| Connector             | Runtime behavior                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `always`              | Run this segment regardless of the previous segment result.                                                                          |
| `then`                | Run after the previous segment; if the previous segment was impossible, continue only when card text says to do as much as possible. |
| `ifPreviousSucceeded` | Run only if the previous segment changed game state or made a legal selection.                                                       |
| `ifYouDo`             | Run only if the player chose/performed the previous optional instruction.                                                            |
| `ifPossible`          | Attempt the segment if there is a legal way to perform it; no error if there is not.                                                 |

A segment result must record at least:

```text
attempted
succeeded
changedState
selectedCards
selectedTargets
paidCost
playerDeclined
```

Those fields drive later connector decisions and replay determinism. Runtime frame, pause/resume, saved-reference, and failure-policy behavior for composed execution is authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s010`, `04-effect-runtime.s012`, and `04-effect-runtime.s016`.

Saved references include `saveResultAs`, `SelectionSetId`, and `SelectionId`. A saved reference is contract-defined here, but generated support may rely on it only when schema validation, parser certification, and runtime capability evidence all cover the reference lifetime, visibility, and later-use legality.

A saved field-object reference is a same-frame saved-reference family for later text such as "that Character". The supported field-object families are `selectedTargets` and `producedObjects`; `selectedCards`, `paidCost`, `SelectionSetId`, `SelectionId`, and saved hand-selection references are separate families and are not field-object target references. A segment with `saveResultAs` may expose `selectedTargets` when it legally selected field objects through a target request, and may expose `producedObjects` when a supported runtime story later creates or moves a public field object and records that object as produced by the segment.

A later segment consumes a saved field-object reference with `{ type: "savedFieldObject", binding: { family: "selectedTargets" | "producedObjects", saveResultAs, objectIndex?, sourceSegmentId? }, zone, player, controller?, filter?, visibility: "publicOnly", onFailure: "failClosed" }`. The reference is valid only inside the same effect execution frame, only for the named `saveResultAs` ledger entry, and only while the referenced object remains a public legal object for the later instruction. unsupported saved-reference families fail closed. stale objects, gone objects, hidden objects, and illegal objects fail closed. Public events, public legal actions, PlayerView, and SpectatorView must not reveal hidden identities or the private saved-reference failure reason. State hashes include the frame saved-reference ledger and the failed segment result so replay, event order, and connector decisions remain deterministic.

Optionality must preserve optional activation, optional cost, and optional effect clause distinctions. These boundaries are part of generated-support capability evidence because a parser that recognizes optional text still cannot make the effect playable unless the runtime can resume and record the correct optional segment result.

Optional cost clauses inside composed sequence execution use a sequence segment
whose effect is `{ type: "payCost"; cost: OptionalCost }`. The optionality flag
lives on the nested `OptionalCost`; `SequencedEffect.optional` remains reserved
for optional effect clauses and must not be used to represent optional cost
decline. Runtime decline for that segment uses the `PayCostDecision` and
`PaymentDeclinedResponse` contract from `03-game-state-events-decisions.s012`
and `03-game-state-events-decisions.s017`.
Optional cost decline uses the active `PayCostDecision` and a
`PaymentDeclinedResponse` payload.

`ifYouDo` after an optional cost runs only when the previous cost segment
recorded `paidCost: true`. A declined or failed optional cost segment does not
run dependent `ifYouDo` segments. Segment-result, event-order, state-hash, and
once-per-turn timing for optional cost accept, decline, and failure are
authoritative in `04-effect-runtime.s011` and `04-effect-runtime.s012`.

### 05-effect-dsl-reference.s022 (Poneglyph text-to-DSL pipeline)

The effect-system plan supports three authoring paths:

1. Manual DSL definitions written by developers.
2. Custom TypeScript handlers for cards that cannot be expressed in DSL.
3. Generated DSL from Poneglyph printed card text when certified parser rules produce a complete parse and runtime capability checks pass.

Support ladder:

1. `contract-defined`: a primitive or behavior is described by the Markdown spec or canonical TypeScript contract.
2. `schema-authorable`: `contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json` can validate JSON fixtures for that primitive.
3. `runtime-executable`: the current runtime capability matrix proves the engine can execute the primitive, including decisions, visibility, replay, failure policy, and pause/resume behavior.
4. `parser-certified`: reviewed parser rules produce a complete parse for the relevant printed text shape.
5. `generated-support playable`: a generated support record may enable normal play only when the parse is complete and every parsed component has current runtime capability evidence.

Schema authorability alone is insufficient for generated-support playable status. Generated support requires runtime capability evidence and complete parser support; schema validation only proves a JSON shape can be authored.

Generated definitions must never be deployed blindly. A new parser rule, ambiguous parse class, custom handler binding, or wording/ruling ambiguity requires review before it can certify support. Once a parser rule is certified, matching complete-parse cards may be generated without a manual per-card allowlist or manual card-to-mechanic map for that common template.

A complete parse covers all gameplay-relevant printed text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement or optionality semantics, and ruling/errata inputs that affect behavior. Multiple parsed effects compose into one generated `EffectDefinition`. Partial parse output may be reported for coverage progress, but it must not make the card playable in normal modes.

Bandai or Poneglyph wording drift must invalidate the affected parse/hash evidence or downgrade support until parser and support evidence are updated. If any parsed component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, or missing runtime capability evidence, the generated definition fails closed instead of partially enabling the card.

```ts
interface EffectDefinitionMetadata {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  source: "poneglyph";
  sourceTextHash: string;
  generatedBy?: "manual" | "rule-parser" | "llm-assisted";
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewedAt?: string;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s010 (Card implementation record)

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";

interface CardImplementationRecord {
  cardId: CardId; // Poneglyph base card ID
  status: CardSupportStatus;
  effectDefinitionId?: string;
  customHandlerIds?: string[];
  generatedSupportId?: string;
  tested: boolean;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  sourceTextHash: string; // hash of Poneglyph printed text used for review drift
  notes?: string;
}
```

A card with printed effect text but no implementation must be marked `unsupported`, not omitted. For common templates, implementation may come from a generated support index entry instead of a manual per-card overlay when the complete parse, parser certification, and runtime capability checks all pass.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s011 (Support policy by mode)

| Status                |              Dev sandbox | Unranked / custom |                         Ranked |
| --------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------: | -----------------------------: |
| `vanilla-confirmed`   |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-dsl`     |                  Allowed |           Allowed |                        Allowed |
| `implemented-custom`  |                  Allowed | Allowed if tested | Allowed if tested and reviewed |
| `unsupported`         |     Allowed with warning |          Rejected |                       Rejected |
| `banned-in-simulator` | Rejected unless override |          Rejected |                       Rejected |

Missing overlay records should fail closed in public modes. A non-vanilla Poneglyph card without support metadata is treated as `unsupported`.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s012 (Deck validation)

Deck validation resolves and validates against Poneglyph IDs, Poneglyph legality records, and simulator support metadata. Poneglyph is the canonical external source for format/card legality inputs such as legal status, bans, and copy limits; the simulator may only layer unsupported-card policy or platform-specific constraints on top.

Generated support index output is simulator support metadata. Deck validation may treat a generated record as `implemented-dsl` or `implemented-custom` only when the record has complete parse evidence, current source/behavior hashes, certified parser-rule evidence, and a runtime capability matrix result proving every component is supported.

```ts
interface DeckValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: DeckValidationError[];
  warnings: DeckValidationWarning[];
  resolvedCards: ResolvedDeckCard[];
  versions: {
    cardDataVersion: string;
    effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
    overlayVersion: string;
    banlistVersion: string;
  };
}
```

Validation checks:

- Leader count and leader identity.
- Main deck size.
- DON!! deck size.
- Leader/color restrictions.
- Per-card copy limits by Poneglyph base `cardId`.
- Official format restrictions.
- Simulator-specific bans.
- Unsupported-card status.
- Variant IDs resolve to valid Poneglyph variants for the base card.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s016 (Generated support from complete parse)

Common-template card support is generated from complete parsing plus runtime capability checks. It must not depend on a manual per-card allowlist or a manual card-to-mechanic map for templates that parser certification already covers.

CARD parser/generated-support stories consume completed contract/schema plus runtime-capability evidence before parser certification or generated-support linkage may enable normal-mode support. Contract/schema completion alone is not playable support.

Complete parse means every gameplay-relevant part of a card is parsed: printed effect text, trigger text, keyword text, costs, conditions, timing windows, target or selection requirements, visibility requirements, replacement effects, optionality, once-per-turn limits, source-presence rules, and official rulings or errata that affect behavior. Non-gameplay display fields such as images and flavor-like presentation do not need DSL parse evidence, but any field that can affect behavior must be represented or explicitly proven irrelevant.

A runtime capability matrix records which generated components the current engine can execute. It must cover at least keyword bodies, DSL primitives, trigger timings, decision/response types, costs, target/selection shapes, movement operations, replacement processes, continuous modifiers, visibility modes, event/hash requirements, and custom handlers. The matrix is versioned with effect/runtime support evidence and must be updated when runtime capabilities expand or contract.

The generated support index maps Poneglyph card IDs and source hashes to generated `EffectDefinition` IDs, parser-rule versions, parser evidence, runtime capability results, support status, and review state. Multiple parsed effects for one card compose into one generated `EffectDefinition` for that card. If every parsed component is supported by the current runtime capability matrix and parser-rule certification allows automatic support, the generated support index may mark the card playable in the appropriate modes.

Partial support reporting is allowed and encouraged for progress tracking. It may report parsed components, unparsed spans, ambiguous parse classes, missing runtime capabilities, stale hashes, and unsupported custom-handler needs. Partial support does not make a card playable in normal modes, and partial support or effect coverage progress never enables normal play.

Generated support fails closed. If any component is unparsed, ambiguous, stale, unsupported, missing capability evidence, missing parser certification, or affected by Bandai/Poneglyph wording drift, the card is rejected for normal play until parser/support evidence is updated. New parser rules, ambiguous parse classes, custom handlers, and wording or ruling ambiguity require review before they can certify support.

### 11-testing-quality.s016 (Coverage gates)

Suggested early gates:

- 90%+ line coverage in `engine-core` for functions excluding generated card data.
- 100% of implemented non-vanilla cards have at least one test.
- 100% of custom handlers have direct tests.
- 0 stale source text hashes in ranked card pool.
- 0 unsupported cards allowed in ranked validation fixtures.
- 0 queue-eligible ranked formats missing ladder configuration.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only packages/cards parser, generated DSL, support gating, diagnostics, and tests for narrow drawUpTo templates. Do not add runtime behavior or use card selection as a substitute for chooseQuantity-backed drawUpTo support.

## Scope

- certify exact-template parser support for `[On Play] Draw up to N card(s).` with positive safe-integer N
- emit deterministic parser rule ID `exact:on-play:draw-up-to-n:self`
- generate DSL `{ type: "drawUpTo", count: N, player: "self" }` using chooseQuantity-backed capability evidence
- include only the `[On Play]` trigger with `sourcePresencePolicy: "mustRemainInSameZone"` and capability evidence ID `sourcePresencePolicy:mustRemainInSameZone`
- fail closed for malformed counts, broad wording, card-selection wording, unsupported trigger wrappers, residue, or missing capability

## Out of Scope

- runtime behavior
- card selection based draw approximations
- broad natural-language draw templates
- real-card proof bundle work
- shared contracts or effect DSL schema changes
- replacement generalization

## Constraints

- generate and activate the CARD-014D packet before implementation
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- do not substitute card selection for drawUpTo runtime capability
- fail closed on trigger, source presence, quantity, or capability ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- exact candidate story-review before approval
- parser tests for exact `[On Play] Draw up to N card(s).` wording and parser rule `exact:on-play:draw-up-to-n:self`
- generated DSL validation test proving exact `{ type: "drawUpTo", count: N, player: "self" }` output
- capability tests proving chooseQuantity-backed drawUpTo evidence is required
- missing drawUpTo capability blocks support test
- missing chooseQuantity-backed capability blocks support test
- missing `sourcePresencePolicy:mustRemainInSameZone` capability blocks support test
- unsupported trigger/sourcePresencePolicy fail-closed tests
- broad wording, card-selection substitute wording, malformed count, and residue fail-closed tests
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- run `corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/cards test`
- full `corepack pnpm verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- exact `[On Play] Draw up to N card(s).` text parses completely to drawUpTo DSL with parser rule `exact:on-play:draw-up-to-n:self`
- generated DSL shape is exactly `{ type: "drawUpTo", count: N, player: "self" }`
- generated support requires `sourcePresencePolicy: "mustRemainInSameZone"` and capability evidence ID `sourcePresencePolicy:mustRemainInSameZone`
- generated support requires chooseQuantity-backed runtime capability evidence
- missing drawUpTo or chooseQuantity capability blocks support
- unsupported trigger/sourcePresencePolicy combinations remain unsupported
- malformed counts and residue text fail closed

## Post-Approval Role Sections

### implementation

Responsibilities
- implement only the approved story using packet authority order
- follow strict TypeScript, lint, and verification requirements
- report ambiguity instead of inventing uncited behavior

Forbidden Actions
- do not broaden scope beyond the approved story boundary or allowed_touch_points
- do not add packet extraction behavior unless the approved story explicitly owns it
- do not implement story-author/story-review handoff mechanics

Required Inputs
- active packet content with authoritative spec references
- approved story scope, non-scope, and acceptance criteria
- allowed_touch_points and required test list

Required Outputs
- scoped code and test changes within approved touch points
- verification command results with pass/fail status
- assumptions and blockers note

Verification Checklist
- confirm required inputs are present and current
- confirm forbidden actions are not introduced
- confirm required outputs are produced for handoff

### code-review

Responsibilities
- review correctness, scope fit, and required-test coverage
- verify no forbidden role sections or lifecycle changes were introduced
- confirm canonical packet behavior remains enforceable

Forbidden Actions
- do not author new feature scope outside the reviewed patch
- do not bypass required tests, packet verification, or CI gate evidence
- do not approve scope drift that violates story boundary

Required Inputs
- proposed patch limited to approved touch points
- active packet, approved story, and cited spec references
- verification and test evidence for required commands

Required Outputs
- review findings prioritized by correctness and scope compliance
- clear disposition for findings (fix/defer/block) with rationale
- review closure recommendation for Session Orchestrator handoff

Verification Checklist
- confirm required inputs are present and current
- confirm forbidden actions are not introduced
- confirm required outputs are produced for handoff

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
```
