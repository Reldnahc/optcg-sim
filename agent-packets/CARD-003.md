## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s004 (Package responsibility: `@optcg/cards`)

`@optcg/cards` owns:

- Poneglyph HTTP client for `api.poneglyph.one`.
- Zod validation of every Poneglyph response before it is cached or handed to the server.
- Read-through Redis cache for Poneglyph card data.
- Merge of Poneglyph data with simulator overlays.
- Card variant metadata for deck builder display.
- Text hash generation from Poneglyph printed text.
- Coverage reports comparing total Poneglyph cards against simulator-supported cards.

`@optcg/cards` does **not** own:

- Engine rule execution.
- Full `GameState`.
- Match WebSocket transport.
- Client-only rendering decisions.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s005 (Read-through cache flow)

The original architecture used a read-through Redis cache rather than a global sync job. That remains the recommended baseline.

```text
server needs card OP01-025
  -> @optcg/cards builds cache key
  -> Redis lookup
      hit  -> validate cached shape/version, return resolved card
      miss -> fetch from Poneglyph
              validate with Zod
              merge simulator overlay
              write Redis with TTL
              return resolved card
```

Default TTL recommendation: 24 hours during normal operation. On new-set release, either flush relevant keys manually or use a short TTL window until the release stabilizes.

Cache key:

```text
card:{cardDataVersion}:{effectDefinitionsVersion}:{overlayVersion}:{cardId}
```

A card-data cache hit only means the Poneglyph metadata is available. It does **not** mean the card is supported by the simulator. Support status is checked separately.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s014 (Canonical Poneglyph normalization)

The Poneglyph adapter emits `ResolvedCard` from `contracts/canonical-types.ts`. Important normalization rules:

- `attribute` values become `attributes: Attribute[]`; never collapse to a singular attribute.
- `color` values become `colors: CardColor[]`; multi-color cards preserve all colors.
- `variants[].index` becomes `variantIndex`.
- `variantKey = `${cardId}:v${variantIndex}``.
- Missing market prices, product set codes, or image URLs are allowed display gaps and must not fail gameplay resolution.
- Search endpoint DTOs are never accepted as manifest card details. Only detail/batch card payloads can become `ResolvedCard`.
- `sourceTextHash` covers printed effect/trigger text used for implementation drift.
- `behaviorHash` covers stats, type line, effect, trigger, official FAQ, errata, and any source field that can alter behavior.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s019 (Failure behavior)

If Poneglyph is unavailable:

| Situation                                         | Behavior                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deck builder display card not cached              | Show degraded/error state; retry.                            |
| Unranked/custom match start with all cards cached | Start normally from cache.                                   |
| Match start requires uncached card                | Fail to start with clear error.                              |
| Ranked queue                                      | Reject deck if all cards cannot be resolved and validated.   |
| In-progress match                                 | Continue from match snapshot; never refetch rules mid-match. |

Poneglyph downtime should not affect matches already created because card data was resolved and snapshotted at match creation.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s022 (Security checklist)

- Server never trusts card metadata from client.
- Poneglyph response is schema-validated before cache write.
- Overlay merge is versioned.
- Match snapshots resolved cards before play starts.
- Unsupported cards are rejected in public modes.
- Variant IDs are cosmetic and never affect rules.
- Poneglyph text hash changes trigger implementation review.
- Replays store versions and manifest hashes.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s023 (Concrete Poneglyph API contract)

The provided OpenAPI document is captured in [`fixtures/poneglyph/openapi.optcg-api-0.1.0.json`](fixtures/poneglyph/openapi.optcg-api-0.1.0.json). The exact adapter contract is now split into [`19-poneglyph-api-contract.md`](19-poneglyph-api-contract.md).

Key implementation rules from the API contract:

- Use `GET /v1/cards/{card_number}` or `POST /v1/cards/batch` for match/deck resolution.
- Batch requests accept at most 60 `card_numbers`, so deck resolution must chunk unique IDs.
- Do not use `/v1/search` results as authoritative card details. Search variants can be filtered by query predicates and the result shape lacks some fields needed for implementation review.
- Treat `legality` as an input to format validation, not as the only authority. Merge it with simulator support status and banlist overlays.
- Keep `official_faq` and variant `errata` in implementation review data because they can change effect behavior.

### 18-acceptance-tests.s007 (Milestone 5 - Poneglyph and deck builder)

```text
M5-001 @optcg/cards fetches Poneglyph metadata and validates with Zod
M5-002 Redis hit returns validated cached Poneglyph card data
M5-003 Poneglyph schema mismatch fails clearly
M5-004 deck validation rejects unknown Poneglyph card ID
M5-005 deck validation rejects unsupported effect card in ranked
M5-006 variant split of same base card is allowed up to base-card limit
M5-007 match creation snapshots card manifest and versions
M5-008 client-fetched Poneglyph display data has no gameplay authority
```

### 18-acceptance-tests.s011 (v3 Poneglyph adapter acceptance tests)

```text
PON-001 OpenAPI fixture parses as JSON and exposes /v1/cards/{card_number}, /v1/cards/batch, /v1/search, /v1/cards/{card_number}/text, /v1/formats.
PON-002 Poneglyph detail Zod schema accepts OP01-060 and OP05-091 fixtures.
PON-003 Batch resolver chunks unique card IDs into requests of <=60 IDs.
PON-004 Batch resolver fails match creation if any requested ID is returned in missing.
PON-005 Search result DTO is rejected as a match-manifest source.
PON-006 OP01-060 variant indexes normalize to OP01-060:v0, OP01-060:v1, OP01-060:v2.
PON-007 OP05-091 variant with null product set_code and null market price normalizes without throwing.
PON-008 sourceTextHash changes when effect or trigger text changes.
PON-009 behaviorHash changes when official_faq, errata, stats, type line, effect, or trigger changes.
PON-010 Unreleased cards are rejected in public modes unless explicitly enabled by format policy.
PON-011 variant_index defaults to 0 and generated variant_key is non-null.
PON-012 search result DTO cannot be used to build MatchCardManifest.
PON-013 attributes and colors normalize as arrays.
```

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s002 (Purpose)

This document tightens the `@optcg/cards` implementation against the provided Poneglyph OpenAPI contract and real card payload examples. The original simulator plan says Poneglyph is the source of truth for printed card text, stats, images, variants, and metadata. This document makes that actionable without giving Poneglyph gameplay authority.

The engine never calls Poneglyph during effect resolution. `@optcg/cards` resolves Poneglyph data, validates it, normalizes it, merges simulator overlays, and produces a match-time manifest.

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s003 (Source fixtures in this package)

```text
fixtures/poneglyph/openapi.optcg-api-0.1.0.json
fixtures/poneglyph/cards/OP01-060.donquixote-doflamingo.json
fixtures/poneglyph/cards/OP05-091.rebecca.json
```

These fixtures should be used for contract tests and early implementation tests before live HTTP is wired in.

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s007 (Normalized card shape)

`@optcg/cards` should normalize Poneglyph records into an engine-safe `ResolvedCard`. Keep the original payload available for audit/debug, but the engine should read the normalized shape.

A critical rule for deck validation: `ResolvedCard.legality` is populated from Poneglyph and is the canonical external legality record the platform validates against. Queue eligibility, unsupported-card rejection, or platform-specific safety blocks may add stricter checks, but they must not invent a separate base legality source.

```ts
interface ResolvedCard {
  cardId: CardId; // from card_number, e.g. "OP05-091"
  language: string;
  name: string;
  category: CardCategory;
  set: string;
  block?: string;
  released: boolean;
  releasedAt?: string;
  rarity?: string;
  colors: Color[];
  cost?: number;
  power?: number;
  counter?: number;
  life?: number;
  attributes: Attribute[];
  types: string[];
  effectText?: string;
  triggerText?: string;
  printedKeywords: Keyword[];
  variants: ResolvedCardVariant[];
  legality: Record<string, PoneglyphLegalityRecord>;
  officialFaq: PoneglyphOfficialFaq[];
  errata: NormalizedErrata[];
  sourceTextHash: string;
  behaviorHash: string;
  support: CardImplementationRecord;
}
```

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s010 (Zod schema policy)

Runtime validation should be strict about required gameplay fields and tolerant of additive non-breaking fields.

```ts
const PoneglyphOfficialFaqSchema = z.object({
  question: z.string(),
  answer: z.string(),
  updated_on: z.string(),
});

const PoneglyphVariantSchema = z
  .object({
    index: z.number().int(),
    name: z.string().nullable(),
    label: z.string().nullable(),
    artist: z.string().nullable(),
    product: z
      .object({
        id: z.string().nullable(),
        slug: z.string().nullable(),
        name: z.string().nullable(),
        set_code: z.string().nullable(),
        released_at: z.string().nullable(),
      })
      .passthrough(),
    images: z
      .object({
        stock: z
          .object({ full: z.string().nullable(), thumb: z.string().nullable() })
          .passthrough(),
        scan: z
          .object({
            display: z.string().nullable(),
            full: z.string().nullable(),
            thumb: z.string().nullable(),
          })
          .passthrough(),
      })
      .passthrough(),
    errata: z.array(z.unknown()),
    market: z
      .object({
        tcgplayer_url: z.string().nullable(),
        market_price: z.string().nullable(),
        low_price: z.string().nullable(),
        mid_price: z.string().nullable(),
        high_price: z.string().nullable(),
      })
      .passthrough(),
  })
  .passthrough();

const PoneglyphCardDetailSchema = z
  .object({
    card_number: z.string(),
    name: z.string(),
    language: z.string(),
    set: z.string(),
    set_name: z.string(),
    released_at: z.string().nullable(),
    released: z.boolean(),
    card_type: z.string(),
    rarity: z.string().nullable(),
    color: z.array(z.string()),
    cost: z.number().int().nullable(),
    power: z.number().int().nullable(),
    counter: z.number().int().nullable(),
    life: z.number().int().nullable(),
    attribute: z.array(z.string()).nullable(),
    types: z.array(z.string()),
    effect: z.string().nullable(),
    trigger: z.string().nullable(),
    block: z.string().nullable(),
    variants: z.array(PoneglyphVariantSchema),
    legality: z.record(
      z
        .object({
          status: z.string(),
          banned_at: z.string().optional(),
          reason: z.string().optional(),
          max_copies: z.number().int().optional(),
          paired_with: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
        })
        .passthrough(),
    ),
    available_languages: z.array(z.string()),
    official_faq: z.array(PoneglyphOfficialFaqSchema),
  })
  .passthrough();
```

Contract tests should also hash the OpenAPI document and alert maintainers if it changes.

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s011 (Adapter API)

```ts
interface PoneglyphClient {
  getCard(
    cardNumber: CardId,
    options?: { lang?: string },
  ): Promise<PoneglyphCardDetail>;
  getCardsBatch(
    cardNumbers: CardId[],
    options?: { lang?: string },
  ): Promise<{
    data: Record<string, PoneglyphCardDetail>;
    missing: string[];
  }>;
  searchCards(query: PoneglyphSearchQuery): Promise<PoneglyphSearchResult>;
  getPlainText(
    cardNumber: CardId,
    options?: { lang?: string },
  ): Promise<string>;
}

interface CardRepository {
  resolveCard(
    cardId: CardId,
    options?: ResolveCardOptions,
  ): Promise<ResolvedCard>;
  resolveCards(
    cardIds: CardId[],
    options?: ResolveCardOptions,
  ): Promise<ResolvedCard[]>;
  buildMatchManifest(decklists: Decklist[]): Promise<MatchCardManifest>;
}
```

Batch resolution must chunk at 60 card numbers and preserve caller order in the returned manifest.

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s012 (Match creation behavior)

1. Collect unique base card IDs from both leaders, main decks, and DON!! decks.
2. Resolve through batch endpoint in chunks of 60.
3. Validate and normalize each returned card.
4. Fail if any requested card appears in `missing`.
5. Merge simulator overlays.
6. Reject unsupported, stale, unreleased, or format-illegal cards according to mode.
7. Snapshot the full match manifest, including hash/version fields.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Each package must expose consistent task names where applicable:

- `build`
- `typecheck`
- `lint`
- `test`
- `test:watch`
- `coverage`

Integration-heavy packages may additionally expose:

- `test:integration`
- `test:replay`
- `test:contracts`
- `test:hidden-info`

At the root, the workspace must provide:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm coverage
pnpm verify
```

`pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command and must run the same core checks as the main merge CI pipeline.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only local/dev fixture capture for selected card IDs and deterministic fixture validation. Do not broaden into full catalog sync, server integration, client display, deck-builder UI, gameplay implementation, or CI live-network dependencies.

## Scope

- add a package-local fixture capture CLI or script for selected Poneglyph card IDs
- fetch only explicit card IDs supplied by the maintainer; do not sync the full catalog
- validate every fetched response with the existing Poneglyph detail validator before writing
- write deterministic JSON fixtures under fixtures/poneglyph/cards with stable ordering and a predictable file naming policy
- support dry-run or validation-only behavior so maintainers can inspect intended fixture paths before writing
- keep tests hermetic by mocking fetch or using local fixtures; no test or CI command may require live Poneglyph
- add package-local tests for successful capture, invalid response failure, missing-card failure, and deterministic file output
- document the maintainer workflow for adding only representative fixtures needed by upcoming stories
- keep representative manifest rebuild/update explicit; do not silently add captured cards to shared representative manifest coverage

## Out of Scope

- full released-card catalog sync
- scheduled or CI live Poneglyph fetches
- Redis, Postgres, server, client, or deck-builder integration
- changing engine-core to import @optcg/cards or live card-data surfaces
- implementing gameplay effects or changing card support status
- automatic effect generation from printed text
- broad fixture expansion beyond tests required for the helper

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/cards/**
- fixtures/poneglyph/cards/**
- docs/workflow/card-fixture-capture.md
- stories/generated/CARD-003-poneglyph-fixture-capture-helper.yaml
- stories/approved/CARD-003-poneglyph-fixture-capture-helper.yaml
- agent-packets/CARD-003.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- do not require live Poneglyph, Redis, server, client, Postgres, or browser code in tests or CI
- keep engine-core free of @optcg/cards and live card-data imports
- validate Poneglyph responses before cache or fixture writes
- fail closed on schema or fetch ambiguity
- do not weaken TypeScript strictness
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

## Required Tests

- package-local fixture capture success test with mocked Poneglyph fetch
- package-local invalid response failure test
- package-local missing-card or non-2xx failure test
- package-local multi-card atomicity test proving one invalid or missing response writes no fixture output
- package-local dry-run test proving intended paths are reported and no files are written
- package-local deterministic output/path test
- root `corepack pnpm test -- packages/cards`
- full `corepack pnpm verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- maintainers can run a package-local command to capture one or more explicit Poneglyph card IDs into checked-in fixture paths
- captured payloads are validated before write and invalid payloads fail closed without partial output
- output JSON is deterministic enough for stable diffs
- dry-run or validation-only mode reports intended fixture paths without writing files
- the helper captures only Poneglyph card detail or batch payloads and never accepts search DTOs as fixture sources
- tests prove the helper without live Poneglyph or Redis
- docs explain that fixture capture is manual/local maintainer tooling and CI uses checked-in fixtures only
- captured cards are not automatically treated as gameplay-supported or added to the representative manifest without explicit follow-up changes

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
