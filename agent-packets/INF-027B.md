# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: INF-027B
Epic ID: KICK-001
Title: Add cleanup metadata parser and eligibility validator
Type: tooling
Area: infra
Primary Concern: tooling

## Why

Add dry-run tooling that parses post-merge cleanup metadata or explicit CLI arguments and fails closed unless the requested single-story or parent cleanup has valid paths, matching story IDs, current packet evidence, and completion eligibility for local planning only.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s010 (Test tooling requirements)

The repo must support the following test lanes:

1. package unit tests,
2. engine interaction tests,
3. invariant/property or fuzz-style tests where applicable,
4. replay determinism tests,
5. hidden-information leakage tests,
6. contract/schema validation tests,
7. smoke integration tests for server protocol behavior.

At minimum, the root verification pipeline must include:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:contracts   # if defined at root via recursive filtering
```

Before public alpha or ranked play, CI must also include replay and hidden-information test lanes.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

A pull request must not merge unless the main CI pipeline passes.

Minimum required merge gates:

1. install dependencies with locked versions,
2. build/typecheck workspace,
3. lint workspace,
4. run tests,
5. validate contracts and schemas,
6. validate formatting,
7. publish coverage artifact,
8. fail if generated artifacts or snapshots are stale when the repo defines them.

Recommended CI jobs:

- `quality` -> lint, typecheck, format check
- `engine` -> engine unit, interaction, invariant, replay tests
- `contracts` -> canonical types, DSL schema, fixture normalization, SQL/schema validation
- `client-server-smoke` -> protocol smoke tests and filtered-view checks

For protected branches, require at least one human review plus passing CI.

Ordinary protected-branch changes still require a pull request, at least one
human review, and passing required checks. The only allowed packet-lifecycle
exception is a dedicated GitHub App actor `optcg-packet-cleanup[bot]` running
workflow `.github/workflows/post-merge-packet-cleanup.yml` with token
`POST_MERGE_PACKET_CLEANUP_TOKEN`, and that exception exists only to push exact
packet-completion command output to `main` after a reviewed pull request has
merged. The cleanup actor and token must not be available to arbitrary GitHub
Actions workflows, human users, broad admin roles, implementation changes, docs
changes, tooling changes, or ordinary development pushes.

### 26-agent-packet-template.s005 (Packet construction rules)

When building a packet from an approved story:

- include only the relevant spec material,
- do not dump the entire spec by default,
- write the packet as a checked-in artifact under `agent-packets/<STORY-ID>.md`,
- include stable metadata for the source story id, story path, and source-story freshness hash so tooling can verify the packet later,
- preserve the `primary_concern`, `story_boundary`, and `allowed_touch_points` exactly,
- preserve exact acceptance criteria from the story,
- preserve non-scope unchanged,
- include the applicable repo rules from [`23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.md`](23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.md),
- include code and architecture constraints from the relevant documents,
- include the approved ambiguity policy,
- allow approved stories to sit without packets until they become active, but require a current checked-in packet before implementation assignment, reviewer assignment, or PR handoff,
- keep the active packet manifest to zero or one active story; activating a story replaces the prior active entry rather than accumulating active implementation targets,
- complete stories through one packet-tool operation that moves the story to done history, removes the active packet, and clears the completed story from the active packet manifest,
- treat the exact file changes produced by that completion operation as generated lifecycle cleanup that needs repo verification but does not need separate reviewer-subagent review unless any manual edits are added,
- split the story before packet generation if the packet would otherwise need multiple unrelated concerns to be implemented together.

### 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s015 (Recommended completion checks for story-driven implementation)

A story should not be marked done unless:

- code behavior matches the cited spec,
- required tests are present and pass,
- repo verification passes,
- the patch stays within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points or the story is updated and re-approved first,
- no prohibited scope creep is introduced,
- any new ambiguity is surfaced explicitly.

After a story is marked done, it should not remain under `stories/approved/`, should not retain an active packet, and should not remain listed in `agent-packets/active.json`. The parent agent owns this cleanup because story state and packet authority are orchestration concerns, not worker or reviewer subagent concerns. Repos should provide a single command for normal single-story completion and a multi-story command for parent-story integration cleanup so story movement, packet removal, and manifest cleanup cannot drift independently. Multi-story cleanup tooling must fail closed when manifest or packet evidence for any listed story is missing or stale.

For parent-story integration branches, substories may remain approved after their substory PRs merge into the parent integration branch because the authoritative merge to `main` has not happened yet. This exception is valid only when the user explicitly approved parent-level human review for the decomposed story group, every substory PR has CI and reviewer-subagent review records, and the final parent PR receives full-story integration review plus human review before merge to `main`.

During that parent-branch window, `agent-packets/active.json` remains a single-story handoff pointer for the currently active or most recently active substory packet. It should not be read as the inventory of unfinished substories. Substories merged only into the parent integration branch stay approved and keep their packet files until the parent PR lands on `main`, even when they no longer appear in `active.json`.

Before human review is requested on a parent PR, the PR body or a handoff comment should be updated from future-tense review plans to completed-gate evidence: included substory PRs, full-story AI review record, revision response, CI result, repo verification result, remaining human-review requirement, and the post-merge `packets:complete-many` cleanup plan.

A commit that contains only the exact file changes produced by the packet completion command is a generated lifecycle cleanup and does not need a separate reviewer-subagent pass. Run the repo verification command before pushing that cleanup. If cleanup requires any manual edit beyond the command output, including edits to packet files, `agent-packets/active.json`, tooling, tests, fixtures, specs, workflow docs, or story files, it is no longer pure generated cleanup and should receive the normal reviewer-subagent pass before push or merge.

Post-merge cleanup metadata is a reviewed cleanup request, not standalone
authority to mutate story state. Cleanup automation must bind the requested
cleanup to reviewed pull-request evidence, the merge state, trusted checked-in
approved story files, current packet evidence, and, for parent cleanup, included
substory evidence before packet completion runs. It must fail closed when
cleanup metadata is absent, malformed, stale, unbound to reviewed evidence, or
names a story that is not eligible for completion.

The cleanup workflow must check out trusted `main` or default-branch code, not
unreviewed pull-request branch code. A direct cleanup commit may be pushed only
by the dedicated cleanup actor after packet-completion output is proven exact
and repo-approved verification passes. The automation must not open a cleanup
pull request. Manual fallback is only for operational failure, not the normal
path. Branch deletion may run only after packet lifecycle cleanup succeeds and
only for associated merged, unprotected story or substory branches.

### 32-codex-agent-integration.s013 (Merge gate recommendation)

A Codex-authored patch should not be merged unless:

- the linked story is still `approved`,
- the patch satisfies the listed acceptance criteria,
- required tests are present and passing,
- no uncited behavior is introduced,
- the review record includes either a reviewer-subagent artifact or an equivalent human review step.

After merge, the story should no longer remain approved or active. The parent agent
should use the packet completion command to move it to `stories/done/` with
`status: done`, remove the active packet, and ensure `agent-packets/active.json`
contains no completed story.

For an explicitly approved parent-story integration branch workflow, substory
pull requests merge into the parent integration branch before the substory is
marked done. Those substories may remain under `stories/approved/` while the
parent integration branch is open, but they must not be marked done until the
parent pull request has merged to `main`. After the parent merge, the parent
agent must use the multi-story packet completion command to move every included
substory to `stories/done/`, remove their packets, and clear any matching active
manifest entry. The multi-story completion command must reject cleanup when
manifest or packet evidence for any listed substory is missing or stale.

While the parent integration branch is open, `agent-packets/active.json` is a
single-story handoff pointer, not a parent-story progress report. It may point to
the current or most recently active substory even after earlier substories have
merged into the parent branch. Those earlier substories remain approved until the
parent PR lands on `main` and the multi-story completion command runs.

Before requesting human review on the parent PR, the parent agent should update
the PR body or post a handoff comment that records completed gates instead of a
future-tense review plan: included substory PRs, full-story reviewer-subagent
record, revision response, CI result, repo verification result, required human
review, and post-merge multi-story cleanup.

Pure packet-completion cleanup does not require reviewer-subagent review when the
commit contains only the exact file changes produced by the packet completion
command and repo verification passes. If cleanup requires any manual edit beyond
that command output, including edits to packet files, `agent-packets/active.json`,
tooling, tests, fixtures, specs, workflow docs, or story files, use the normal
separate reviewer-subagent review path before pushing or merging.

Post-merge cleanup metadata is a reviewed cleanup request, not standalone
authority to mutate story state. Cleanup automation must bind the requested
cleanup to reviewed pull-request evidence, the merge state, trusted checked-in
approved story files, current packet evidence, and, for parent cleanup, included
substory evidence before packet completion runs. It must fail closed when
cleanup metadata is absent, malformed, stale, unbound to reviewed evidence, or
names a story that is not eligible for completion.

The cleanup workflow must check out trusted `main` or default-branch code, not
unreviewed pull-request branch code. A direct cleanup commit may be pushed only
by the dedicated cleanup actor after packet-completion output is proven exact
and repo-approved verification passes. The automation must not open a cleanup
pull request. Manual fallback is only for operational failure, not the normal
path. Branch deletion may run only after packet lifecycle cleanup succeeds and
only for associated merged, unprotected story or substory branches.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own cleanup metadata parsing and local dry-run validation only. Do not call GitHub, bind metadata to PR review evidence, add GitHub Actions, push commits, delete branches, or change packet completion command semantics in this story. The dry-run output is not cleanup-authorizing until INF-027C binds it to reviewed PR evidence and merge state.

## Scope

- parse the preferred cleanup metadata block from PR text
- support `mode: single` with one approved story path
- support `mode: parent` with multiple approved story paths
- parse optional branch names without deciding deletion safety
- support explicit CLI arguments for local dry-run validation
- validate story paths are exact paths under `stories/approved/`
- validate metadata story IDs match story file IDs
- validate packet files exist and match story IDs, story paths, and current story hashes
- validate listed stories are approved and eligible for completion
- emit deterministic local dry-run JSON for later workflow consumption
- state in dry-run output that the plan is not cleanup-authorizing until INF-027C binds it to reviewed PR evidence and merge state

## Out of Scope

- validating GitHub PR review state or merge state
- running packet completion commands
- verifying git diff output after packet completion
- GitHub Actions workflow creation
- direct pushes to main
- branch deletion
- cleanup PR creation
- story schema changes

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- package.json
- tools/post-merge-cleanup.ts
- tools/post-merge-cleanup/**
- tools/tsconfig.json
- tests/contracts/**
- tests/fixtures/post-merge-cleanup/**
- stories/generated/INF-027B-*.yaml
- stories/approved/INF-027B-*.yaml
- agent-packets/INF-027B.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- validation must not edit files
- validation must not call GitHub
- validation must not use write-capable tokens
- do not activate or implement this story before INF-027A lands because INF-027A owns the documented metadata shape
- fail closed on ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

## Required Tests

- parser tests for valid single-story metadata
- parser tests for valid parent metadata
- parser tests for missing, malformed, ambiguous, duplicate, and broad-glob metadata
- validator tests for outside paths, story ID mismatch, stale packet, missing packet, and ineligible story
- package script smoke test for cleanup validation command

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- valid single-story cleanup metadata yields a deterministic dry-run plan
- valid parent cleanup metadata yields a deterministic dry-run plan with multiple stories
- missing, malformed, or ambiguous metadata fails closed
- story paths outside `stories/approved/` fail closed
- broad globs, generated paths, done paths, and duplicate story paths fail closed
- story ID mismatches fail closed
- stale or missing packet evidence fails closed
- non-approved or already-done stories fail closed
- package scripts expose the dry-run validation behavior
- dry-run output is explicitly local-only and not cleanup-authorizing before INF-027C binding exists

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
