# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-054A
Epic ID: ENG-054
Title: Replace PlayerView event payload deny-listing with allow-list projection
Type: implementation
Area: engine
Primary Concern: visibility

## Why

Replace filterStateForPlayer event payload projection's recursive forbidden-key deny list with explicit event-type allow-list projection so future event payload keys do not leak to PlayerView by default.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s005 (Event journal)

Every atomic mutation emits events. Trigger detection consumes events, not actions.

Event sequencing is part of the replay and state-hash contract:

- EngineResult.events from one accepted transition must be strictly increasing by
  `seq`.
- The final `state.eventJournal` must be strictly increasing by `seq`.
- Event `seq` values must be allocated by append order.
- Helpers must not create multiple events in one `push` call when event IDs or seq values depend on `events.length`; append events one at a time or use an
  equivalent allocator that observes the already-appended event count.

```ts
interface EngineEvent {
  id: EngineEventId;
  seq: number;
  type: EngineEventType;
  actor?: PlayerId;
  source?: CardRef;
  affected?: CardRef[];
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy?: CausalityRef;
  visibility: EventVisibility;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

type EngineEventType =
  | "phaseStarted"
  | "phaseEnded"
  | "cardRevealed"
  | "cardMoved"
  | "cardPlayed"
  | "cardDrawn"
  | "cardDiscarded"
  | "cardTrashed"
  | "cardKOd"
  | "cardReturned"
  | "donAttached"
  | "donReturned"
  | "costPaid"
  | "attackDeclared"
  | "blockerActivated"
  | "counterUsed"
  | "damageWouldBeDealt"
  | "damageDealt"
  | "lifeTaken"
  | "triggerActivated"
  | "effectQueued"
  | "effectResolved"
  | "replacementApplied"
  | "decisionCreated"
  | "decisionResolved"
  | "ruleProcessingChecked"
  | "gameEnded";
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s006 (Event visibility)

Events may contain hidden data. Filter them before sending to clients.

```ts
type EventVisibility =
  | { type: "public" }
  | { type: "private"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "hidden" }
  | { type: "replayOnly" };
```

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s018 (Canonical event visibility)

Each `EngineEvent` has one visibility policy:

```text
public          safe for both players immediately
private         visible only to listed player IDs
replayOnly      hidden during live play but available in completed full replay
serverOnly      never leaves trusted server/runtime logs
```

Visibility is independent of replay determinism. Replay artifacts may store information that was never sent to either player during the live match.

### 06-visibility-security.s002 (Security principle)

The server holds `GameState`. Clients receive filtered views. A raw `GameState` must never leave the match server except for trusted internal debugging, persistence, or completed replay storage.

```ts
filterStateForPlayer(state, playerId) -> PlayerView
filterStateForSpectator(state, spectatorPolicy) -> SpectatorView
filterStateForReplay(state) -> ReplayView
```

If a field is not explicitly allowed in a view, it is hidden.

### 06-visibility-security.s004 (PlayerView shape)

```ts
interface PlayerView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  self: VisiblePlayerState;
  opponent: OpponentVisibleState;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PublicDecision;
  legalActions: PublicLegalAction[];
  revealedCards: PublicRevealRecord[];
  events: EngineEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Do not include:

- Deck order.
- Opponent hand card IDs.
- Face-down life card IDs.
- RNG seed/internal state.
- Effect queue internals.
- Private decision candidates not visible to recipient.
- Internal crash/recovery metadata.

Canonical public support DTOs for the initial live view contract:

```ts
type SpectatorPolicy = {
  mode: "disabled" | "live-filtered";
  allowHandRevealAfterGame: boolean;
};

interface PublicTurnState {
  globalTurn: number;
  playerTurnCounts: Record<PlayerId, number>;
  turnPlayerId: PlayerId;
  phase: "refresh" | "draw" | "don" | "main" | "end";
  step?: BattleStep;
}

interface PublicBattleState {
  attacker: CardRef;
  originalTarget: CardRef;
  currentTarget: CardRef;
  blocker?: CardRef;
  step: BattleStep;
  damageCount: number;
}

interface PublicCardView {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  attachedDonCount: number;
  turnPlayed?: number;
}

interface PublicLifeView {
  count: number;
  faceUpCards: PublicCardView[];
}

interface VisiblePlayerState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  hand: PublicCardView[];
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

interface OpponentVisibleState {
  playerId: PlayerId;
  deckCount: number;
  donDeckCount: number;
  handCount: number;
  trash: PublicCardView[];
  leader: PublicCardView;
  characters: PublicCardView[];
  stage?: PublicCardView;
  costArea: PublicCardView[];
  life: PublicLifeView;
  hasMulliganed: boolean;
  turnCount: number;
}

type SpectatorVisiblePlayerState = OpponentVisibleState;

interface PublicDecision {
  id: DecisionId;
  type: string;
  playerId: PlayerId;
  prompt: string;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

type PublicLegalAction =
  | { type: "playCard"; card: CardRef; costPaymentRequired?: boolean }
  | { type: "activateEffect"; source: CardRef; effectId: EffectId }
  | { type: "attachDon"; don: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "declareAttack"; attacker: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "activateBlocker"; blocker: CardRef }
  | { type: "useCounter"; card: CardRef; target: CardRef }
  | { type: "endMainPhase" }
  | { type: "concede"; playerId: PlayerId }
  | { type: "respondToDecision"; decisionId: DecisionId };

interface PublicRevealRecord {
  id: string;
  cards: CardRef[];
  visibility: "public" | "privateToRecipient";
  origin: ZoneRef | "topOfDeck" | "lifeDamage" | "custom";
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  cleanupPolicy: "returnToOrigin" | "trashAfterResolution" | "none";
}

type SpectatorRevealRecord = Omit<PublicRevealRecord, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: "public";
};

type SpectatorEvent = Omit<EngineEvent, "visibility"> & {
  visibility: { type: "public" };
};
```

Initial live-filtered spectator view is distinct from `PlayerView`:

```ts
interface SpectatorView {
  matchId: MatchId;
  stateSeq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  spectatorPolicy: SpectatorPolicy;
  turn: PublicTurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, SpectatorVisiblePlayerState>;
  battle?: PublicBattleState;
  revealedCards: SpectatorRevealRecord[];
  events: SpectatorEvent[];
  timers: PublicTimerState;
}
```

Initial `SpectatorView` has no `pendingDecision` or `legalActions` field.
It does not include either player's hand card IDs, deck order, face-down life
card IDs, private reveal records, non-public events, RNG state, effect queue
internals, or audit entries. Full-information live spectating is deferred to a
future explicit policy story.

### 06-visibility-security.s017 (Filter checklist)

Before any state leaves the server:

```ts
assertNoDeckContents(view);
assertNoOpponentHandContents(view);
assertNoFaceDownLifeContents(view);
assertNoRngState(view);
assertNoEffectQueueInternals(view);
assertNoPrivateDecisionCandidates(view);
assertRevealRecordsAreRecipientFiltered(view);
assertLegalActionsDoNotLeakOpponentHiddenInfo(view);
assertSpectatorPolicyApplied(view);
```

Run these in tests for every `PlayerView` fixture.

### 06-visibility-security.s021 (Original state-filtering categories preserved)

The mechanical spec separated visibility into multiple view categories. The implementation should keep separate filters rather than one generic serializer.

| View                   | Purpose                      | Hidden-info policy                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PlayerView`           | Active player UI             | Own hand visible; opponent hidden zones counted only.                              |
| `SpectatorView`        | Spectator UI                 | Initial `live-filtered` mode shows public board/zones and hidden-zone counts only. |
| `ReplayView`           | Completed replay             | Can show full state after match completion, subject to replay visibility policy.   |
| Temporary reveal view  | Resolving effects            | Shows only currently revealed cards to allowed recipients.                         |
| Battle-specific view   | Attack/block/counter windows | Shows battle context without leaking opponent counters unless revealed.            |
| Effect-resolution view | Search/look/choice prompts   | Private candidates visible only to choosing player unless effect says reveal.      |

### 06-visibility-security.s023 (Security checklist from source spec)

Before sending any match data to a player, spectator, or replay consumer, assert:

- Opponent hand contains only count, not card IDs.
- Decks expose count only, not order or card IDs.
- Face-down life exposes count only, not card IDs.
- Revealed life cards are visible only while legally revealed.
- Private search/look candidates are visible only to the searching player unless `reveal=true`.
- RNG seed/state is absent.
- Internal effect queue is absent.
- Pending decisions are recipient-filtered.
- Auto-pass timing does not reveal whether hidden counter options existed.
- Spectator delay/filter policy was applied.

### 11-testing-quality.s004 (Unit tests per DSL primitive)

Every primitive has tests independent of specific cards:

- `draw`
- `ko`
- `trash`
- `bounce`
- `search`
- `lookAtTop`
- `modifyPower`
- `modifyCost`
- `giveKeyword`
- `replacement`
- `damage`
- `addLife`
- `attachDon`
- `returnDon`
- `choice`
- `conditional`
- `sequence`

Primitive tests should assert events, state, decisions, and visibility where applicable.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only PlayerView event payload projection and focused hidden-info regression coverage for visible event payloads. Preserve event visibility filtering, event ordering, event ids, state hashes, event creation semantics, replay format, DTO contracts, protocol behavior, effect runtime behavior, and gameplay rules.

## Scope

- confirm the current PlayerView event payload projection recursively passes through all payload keys except a fixed forbidden-key list
- keep toPlayerEvent as the central PlayerView event projection point
- replace generic recursive deny-list payload filtering with explicit event-type-specific payload projection helpers
- keep effectQueued projection limited to safe queued status
- keep effectResolved projection limited to safe resolved status
- project unknown or unsupported visible event payload shapes as empty or minimal safe payloads instead of arbitrary keys
- add focused regression coverage proving a visible event with a dangerous unexpected payload key does not expose that key through PlayerView.events
- preserve existing public event metadata, visibility filtering, event ordering, event ids, state hashes, and safe public payload behavior

## Out of Scope

- changing event creation semantics or engine event journal contents
- changing replay format or replay validation behavior
- changing canonical DTO contracts or package type contracts
- changing public legal-action projection
- changing effect runtime, replacement mechanics, target selection, card data, protocol, server, client, UI, or gameplay rules
- adding broad event payload schema validation outside PlayerView projection

## Allowed Touch Points

- packages/engine-core/src/filter-state-for-player.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/filter-state-for-player.real-states-*.test.ts

- stories/approved/ENG-054A-playerview-event-payload-allow-list.yaml
- agent-packets/ENG-054A.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-054A packet while implementing this story
- run packet verification before implementation handoff, reviewer handoff, and PR handoff
- use one implementation worker by default for this active story
- stay within allowed_touch_points
- fail closed on hidden-information ambiguity instead of widening the public payload contract
- use `corepack pnpm`, not plain `pnpm`, when running repo commands in this environment
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- run `corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/filter-state-for-player.test.ts`
- run `corepack pnpm exec vitest run tests/hidden-info`
- run `corepack pnpm run packets:verify`
- run `corepack pnpm run stories:validate`
- run `corepack pnpm run verify` if feasible

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- PlayerView.events no longer pass arbitrary event payload keys by default
- existing safe event payload projections still work through explicit event-type projection
- effectQueued projects only safe queued status
- effectResolved projects only safe resolved status
- a regression test proves an unexpected dangerous payload key such as hiddenCardIds, rawProcessPayload, or privateCandidates is omitted
- event visibility filtering, event ordering, event ids, state hashes, and event journal contents are preserved
- hidden-information tests pass
- no unrelated DTO, replay, protocol, card-data, or gameplay changes are included
