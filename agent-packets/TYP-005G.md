# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: TYP-005G
Epic ID: TYP-005
Title: Add whole-surface type parity guard
Type: verification
Area: contracts
Primary Concern: verification

## Why

Add merge-blocking verification so future one-sided drift between canonical contract modules and `@optcg/types` package projection output fails mechanically across the whole surface.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 22-v6-implementation-tightening.s006 (2. TypeScript model)

The old `16-typescript-interface-draft.md` was a draft and referenced undefined symbols. The implementation contract is now `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

Resolved and normalized items include:

- `Color` -> `CardColor`
- `Attribute`
- `ZoneRef`
- `MatchCardManifest`
- `RngState`
- `EffectQueueEntry`
- `ContinuousEffect`
- `EventVisibility`
- `CardRef`
- `DecisionResponse`
- `Cost`
- `PaymentOption`
- `TargetRequest`
- `CardSelectionRequest`
- `EffectOption`
- `PublicEffectEvent` replacement via filtered `EngineEvent[]`
- `PlayerView` and initial live-filtered `SpectatorView`
- public live-view DTO support contracts
- spectator-safe public-only reveal and event DTOs
- `eventLog`/`eventJournal` conflict resolved to `eventJournal`
- `activeBattle`/`battle` conflict resolved to `battle`
- serializable arrays instead of `Set`

The contract compiles with:

```bash
cd contracts
tsc -p tsconfig.json
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Each package must expose consistent task names where applicable:

- `build`
- `typecheck`
- `lint`
- `test`
- `test:watch`
- `coverage`

Integration-heavy packages may additionally expose:

- `test:integration`
- `test:replay`
- `test:contracts`
- `test:hidden-info`

At the root, the workspace must provide:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm coverage
pnpm verify
```

`pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command and must run the same core checks as the main merge CI pipeline.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s011 (Contract and fixture validation)

The repo must validate the canonical contract files and fixtures automatically.

Required checks:

- `contracts/canonical-types.ts` compiles under `contracts/tsconfig.json`
- effect DSL fixtures validate against `contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json`
- card fixture normalization tests run against real supplied fixture payloads
- replay fixtures remain loadable and hash-stable
- schema/DDL files parse successfully in CI

A change to DSL shape, card manifests, or replay structure is incomplete unless fixtures are updated in the same change.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

A pull request must not merge unless the main CI pipeline passes.

Minimum required merge gates:

1. install dependencies with locked versions,
2. build/typecheck workspace,
3. lint workspace,
4. run tests,
5. validate contracts and schemas,
6. validate formatting,
7. publish coverage artifact,
8. fail if generated artifacts or snapshots are stale when the repo defines them.

Recommended CI jobs:

- `quality` -> lint, typecheck, format check
- `engine` -> engine unit, interaction, invariant, replay tests
- `contracts` -> canonical types, DSL schema, fixture normalization, SQL/schema validation
- `client-server-smoke` -> protocol smoke tests and filtered-view checks

For protected branches, require at least one human review plus passing CI.

Ordinary protected-branch changes still require a pull request, at least one
human review, and passing required checks. The only allowed packet-lifecycle
exception is a dedicated GitHub App actor `optcg-packet-cleanup[bot]` running
workflow `.github/workflows/post-merge-packet-cleanup.yml` with token
`POST_MERGE_PACKET_CLEANUP_TOKEN`, and that exception exists only to push exact
packet-completion command output to `main` after a reviewed pull request has
merged. The cleanup actor and token must not be available to arbitrary GitHub
Actions workflows, human users, broad admin roles, implementation changes, docs
changes, tooling changes, or ordinary development pushes.

Exact packet-completion cleanup may use cleanup-scoped lifecycle verification
instead of full repo verification before the direct cleanup push. Cleanup-scoped
lifecycle verification must prove metadata binding, packet-completion output,
story lifecycle state, active packet state, and committed story metadata remain
valid. Normal main-branch CI remains the broad post-cleanup safety net after
the cleanup commit is pushed. Cleanup that includes any manual edit beyond
packet-completion output still requires full repo verification and the normal
reviewer-subagent path before push or merge.

### 24-story-schema.s016 (`spec_refs`)

List of exact spec section references that authorize the story. These references are mandatory. In v6, `spec_refs` should use stable `SECTION_REF` identifiers such as `07-match-server-protocol.s010 (Timers)` instead of renderer-specific heading anchors. The story must not ask the agent to invent uncited behavior.

### 24-story-schema.s025 (Story sizing rules)

Approved stories should usually fit within a single reviewable pull request. The primary sizing rule is concern boundary, not raw diff size. Broad gameplay or platform capabilities should become epics. The approved stories inside an epic should be sliced by one primary concern at a time.

A story is too large if it:

- combines multiple primary concerns such as contract plus rules, rules plus protocol, or protocol plus UI in one assignment,
- changes multiple systems with different review concerns,
- requires the agent to choose architecture rather than implement it,
- cannot state acceptance criteria in a few bullets,
- cannot be validated by a targeted set of tests,
- cannot be reverted independently without backing out unrelated work,
- needs repeated "and also" scope clauses to explain what it does.

Warning signals may still justify a split, but they are secondary to concern boundaries:

- unusually large diffs,
- creation or expansion of large multi-purpose files,
- acceptance criteria that read like an end-to-end milestone instead of one reviewable concern.

Tests, fixtures, snapshots, and docs that directly prove the same concern do not count as a second concern by themselves.

### 24-story-schema.s031 (`story_boundary`)

One or two sentences describing what the story owns and where it must stop. This field exists because `non_scope` alone often becomes a loose list; the boundary statement should make the intended stopping point obvious to authors, implementers, and reviewers.

### 24-story-schema.s032 (`allowed_touch_points`)

List of packages, directories, modules, or other implementation surfaces the story is expected to modify. This is both a review aid and a future automation hook for detecting scope creep between the approved story and the resulting patch.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only whole-surface parity, export, and stale-output enforcement after the package projection migration is complete.

## Scope

- add or finish whole-surface parity enforcement between canonical modules and package projection output
- ensure missing canonical exports fail verification
- ensure stale package projection output fails verification
- wire the guard into the root contracts lane and root `verify`

## Out of Scope

- changing canonical contracts
- changing package projection declarations except tests or guard wiring
- engine, server, client, replay, gameplay, database, or UI behavior

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- package.json
- packages/types/src/export-cohesion.test.ts
- tests/contracts/package-type-sync-tool.test.mjs
- tests/contracts/package-type-parity.test.mjs
- tests/contracts/root-contracts-lane.test.mjs
- docs/contracts/type-authority.md
- stories/approved/TYP-005G-whole-surface-type-parity-guard.yaml

## Constraints

- do not use the guard story to resolve newly discovered type-shape disputes
- depend on the replacement TYP-005F output after the old TYP-005C/TYP-005D path has been lifecycle-transitioned out of stories/approved
- raise a separate ambiguity or contract story if canonical authority is incomplete
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- exact candidate story-review before implementation
- focused parity test proving stale package output fails
- focused parity test proving missing package export fails
- root contracts-lane test proving the guard is included
- run `corepack pnpm exec vitest run tests/contracts/package-type-parity.test.mjs tests/contracts/package-type-sync-tool.test.mjs tests/contracts/root-contracts-lane.test.mjs`
- run `corepack pnpm run contracts`
- run `corepack pnpm run verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- root contract verification fails on stale package output
- root contract verification fails on missing canonical exports from `@optcg/types`
- guard covers the full canonical module mapping, not only known blocker fields
- dependency resolves to the replacement TYP-005F package projection story, not the superseded old parity-guard story
- `pnpm verify` includes the guard through the contracts lane or an equally explicit root path

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
