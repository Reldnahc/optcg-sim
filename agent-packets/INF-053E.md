# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: INF-053E
Epic ID: INF-053
Title: Clarify cleanup guard and handoff preflight evidence
Type: refactor
Area: docs
Primary Concern: docs

## Why

Clarify the boundary between the remote cleanup-metadata-guard check and the full cleanup handoff preflight so agents understand which evidence each gate proves before human-review handoff.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s015 (Recommended completion checks for story-driven implementation)

A story should not be marked done unless:

- code behavior matches the cited spec,
- required tests are present and pass,
- repo verification passes,
- the patch stays within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points or the story is updated and re-approved first,
- no prohibited scope creep is introduced,
- any new ambiguity is surfaced explicitly.

After a story is marked done, it should not remain under `stories/approved/`, should not retain an active packet, and should not remain listed in `agent-packets/active.json`. The parent agent owns this cleanup because story state and packet authority are orchestration concerns, not worker or reviewer subagent concerns. Repos should provide a single command for normal single-story completion and a multi-story command for parent-story integration cleanup so story movement, packet removal, and manifest cleanup cannot drift independently. Multi-story cleanup tooling must fail closed when manifest or packet evidence for any listed story is missing or stale.

For parent-story integration branches, substories may remain approved after their reviewed substory commits land on the parent integration branch because the authoritative merge to `main` has not happened yet. This exception is valid only when the parent story set uses parent-level human review, every substory commit has CI, reviewer-subagent review evidence, AI review record, revision response record, and verification evidence bound to the exact commit, and the final parent PR receives full-story integration review plus human review before merge to `main`.

During that parent-branch window, `agent-packets/active.json` remains a single-story handoff pointer for the currently active or most recently active substory packet. It should not be read as the inventory of unfinished substories. Substories merged only into the parent integration branch stay approved and keep their packet files until the parent PR lands on `main`, even when they no longer appear in `active.json`.

Before human review is requested on a parent PR, the PR body or a handoff comment should be updated from future-tense review language to completed-gate evidence: included substory story path + commit SHA + AI review record + revision response + verification evidence, full-story AI review record, revision response, CI result, repo verification result, remaining human-review requirement, and the post-merge `packets:complete-many` cleanup plan.

A commit that contains only the exact file changes produced by the packet completion command is a generated lifecycle cleanup and does not need a separate reviewer-subagent pass; exact packet-completion cleanup may use cleanup-scoped lifecycle verification instead of full repo verification before the direct cleanup push. Cleanup-scoped lifecycle verification must prove metadata binding, packet-completion output, story lifecycle state, active packet state, and committed story metadata remain valid; cleanup that includes any manual edit beyond packet-completion output still requires full repo verification and the normal reviewer-subagent path before push or merge. This includes edits to packet files, `agent-packets/active.json`, tooling, tests, fixtures, specs, workflow docs, or story files.

Post-merge cleanup metadata is a reviewed cleanup request, not standalone
authority to mutate story state. Cleanup automation must bind the requested
cleanup to reviewed pull-request evidence, the merge state, trusted checked-in
approved story files, current packet evidence, and, for parent cleanup, included
substory evidence before packet completion runs. It must fail closed when
cleanup metadata is absent, malformed, stale, unbound to reviewed evidence, or
names a story that is not eligible for completion.

The cleanup workflow must check out trusted `main` or default-branch code, not
unreviewed pull-request branch code. A direct cleanup commit may be pushed only
by the dedicated cleanup actor after packet-completion output is proven exact
and cleanup-scoped lifecycle verification passes. Normal main-branch CI remains
the broad post-cleanup safety net after the cleanup commit is pushed. The
automation must not open a cleanup
pull request. Manual fallback is only for operational failure, not the normal
path. Branch deletion may run only after packet lifecycle cleanup succeeds and
only for associated merged, unprotected story or substory branches.

### 32-codex-agent-integration.s013 (Merge gate recommendation)

A Codex-authored patch should not be merged unless:

- the linked story is still `approved`,
- the patch satisfies the listed acceptance criteria,
- required tests are present and passing,
- no uncited behavior is introduced,
- the review record includes either a reviewer-subagent artifact or an equivalent human review step.
- protected or default-branch PRs have human review before merge.

After merge, the story should no longer remain approved or active. The parent agent
should use the packet completion command to move it to `stories/done/` with
`status: done`, remove the active packet, and ensure `agent-packets/active.json`
contains no completed story.

For an explicitly approved parent-story integration branch workflow, substory
pull requests merge into the parent integration branch before the substory is
marked done. Those substories may remain under `stories/approved/` while the
parent integration branch is open, but they must not be marked done until the
parent pull request has merged to `main`. After the parent merge, the parent
agent must use the multi-story packet completion command to move every included
substory to `stories/done/`, remove their packets, and clear any matching active
manifest entry. The multi-story completion command must reject cleanup when
manifest or packet evidence for any listed substory is missing or stale.

While the parent integration branch is open, `agent-packets/active.json` is a
single-story handoff pointer, not a parent-story progress report. It may point to
the current or most recently active substory even after earlier substories have
merged into the parent branch. Those earlier substories remain approved until the
parent PR lands on `main` and the multi-story completion command runs.

Before requesting human review on the parent PR, the parent agent should update
the PR body or post a handoff comment that records completed gates instead of a
future-tense review language: included substory story path + commit SHA + AI review record + revision response + verification evidence, full-story reviewer-subagent
record, revision response, CI result, repo verification result, required human
review, and post-merge multi-story cleanup.

Pure packet-completion cleanup does not require reviewer-subagent review when the
commit contains only the exact file changes produced by the packet completion
command and cleanup-scoped lifecycle verification passes; exact
packet-completion cleanup may use cleanup-scoped lifecycle verification instead
of full repo verification before the direct cleanup push. Cleanup-scoped
lifecycle verification must prove metadata binding, packet-completion output,
story lifecycle state, active packet state, and committed story metadata remain
valid; cleanup that includes any manual edit beyond packet-completion output
still requires full repo verification and the normal reviewer-subagent path
before push or merge; this includes edits to packet files,
`agent-packets/active.json`, tooling, tests, fixtures, specs, workflow docs, or
story files.

Post-merge cleanup metadata is a reviewed cleanup request, not standalone
authority to mutate story state. Cleanup automation must bind the requested
cleanup to reviewed pull-request evidence, the merge state, trusted checked-in
approved story files, current packet evidence, and, for parent cleanup, included
substory evidence before packet completion runs. It must fail closed when
cleanup metadata is absent, malformed, stale, unbound to reviewed evidence, or
names a story that is not eligible for completion.

The cleanup workflow must check out trusted `main` or default-branch code, not
unreviewed pull-request branch code. A direct cleanup commit may be pushed only
by the dedicated cleanup actor after packet-completion output is proven exact
and cleanup-scoped lifecycle verification passes. Normal main-branch CI remains
the broad post-cleanup safety net after the cleanup commit is pushed. The
automation must not open a cleanup
pull request. Manual fallback is only for operational failure, not the normal
path. Branch deletion may run only after packet lifecycle cleanup succeeds and
only for associated merged, unprotected story or substory branches.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own only cleanup-guard versus handoff-preflight wording and workflow tests unless the story intentionally changes cleanup-metadata-guard behavior. Prefer documentation and tests over workflow behavior changes.

## Scope

- document that remote cleanup-metadata-guard validates cleanup metadata source and shape from PR body/comments
- document that full cleanup handoff preflight binds fetched changed files, PR head branch, status checks, and reviewed PR evidence
- update PR template and workflow tests to preserve that distinction
- change `.github/workflows/cleanup-metadata-guard.yml` only if intentionally upgrading the remote guard inputs

## Out of Scope

- broad cleanup automation redesign
- changing post-merge packet completion semantics
- changing cleanup metadata syntax

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- AGENTS.md
- docs/workflow/story-execution.md
- docs/workflow/review-gate.md
- docs/workflow/parent-integration-branches.md
- .github/pull_request_template.md
- .github/workflows/cleanup-metadata-guard.yml
- tests/github/review-workflow.test.mjs

## Constraints

- prefer wording/test cleanup unless intentionally upgrading workflow behavior
- if workflow behavior changes, preserve trusted-code and fail-closed cleanup semantics
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

### Code Standard

Follow [`docs/code-standard.md`](docs/code-standard.md). Non-negotiables:

- stay inside the approved story boundary
- preserve package boundaries
- use strict TypeScript without `any`, routine non-null assertions, or ignored TS errors
- prefer named exports and precise types
- keep files cohesive; 500 effective lines is suspect, 800 is high-risk, 1000 is the hard mechanical guard
- split by reason-to-change, not by line count
- do not over-split into tiny files or generic dumping grounds
- keep engine-core pure and hidden-info safe
- prove engine behavior with synthetic/unit/regression tests
- keep real-card fixture tests separate from engine behavior requirements
- preserve deterministic event ordering and state hashes
- record ambiguity instead of inventing behavior

## Required Tests

- run `corepack pnpm run test -- tests/github/review-workflow.test.mjs`
- run `corepack pnpm verify`, or record why unavailable

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- workflow docs and PR template no longer imply the remote guard proves full reviewed-scope binding by itself
- docs require full handoff preflight before reviewer handoff, human review request, or ready-for-human-review language
- tests distinguish remote guard proof from full handoff-preflight proof

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
