# Story Packet

## Story

Spec Version: v6
Story Schema Version: 1.0.0
ID: ENG-032I
Epic ID: KICK-001
Title: Split battle pipeline regression tests
Type: refactor
Area: engine
Primary Concern: verification

## Why

Move existing cross-mechanic battle pipeline regression tests out of battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts into focused regression files without changing assertions, fixtures, events, state hashes, or behavior.

## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 02-engine-mechanics.s006 (Zone transition rules)

When a card moves from field to another zone, it becomes a new card instance. Applied effects are stripped. Instance identity must reset when appropriate.

```ts
interface CardInstance {
  instanceId: InstanceId;
  cardId: CardId;
  owner: PlayerId;
  controller: PlayerId;
  zone: ZoneRef;
  state?: "active" | "rested";
  turnPlayed?: number;
  attachedDon?: InstanceId[];
}
```

When multiple cards are placed into a zone simultaneously, the owner chooses their order. If the destination is secret, the opponent must not see the chosen order unless the game rules explicitly reveal it.

When a card with attached DON!! leaves the field, attached DON!! return to the owner's cost area rested.

### 02-engine-mechanics.s008 (Setup sequence)

Use a deterministic setup flow:

```text
1. Validate decks, card support, format, banlist.
2. Determine first/second player.
3. Build initial full GameState.
4. Resolve start-of-game effects that modify setup.
5. Shuffle decks using recorded RNG.
6. Draw opening hands.
7. Handle official mulligan decisions: each player may once either keep or return all 5 to deck, reshuffle, and redraw 5, in first-player-then-second-player order.
8. Place Life from the top of deck equal to Leader life using the canonical orientation algorithm below.
9. Start first player's Refresh Phase.
```

Start-of-game effects that alter decks must happen before final shuffle and opening draw.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s018 (Canonical event visibility)

Each `EngineEvent` has one visibility policy:

```text
public          safe for both players immediately
private         visible only to listed player IDs
replayOnly      hidden during live play but available in completed full replay
serverOnly      never leaves trusted server/runtime logs
```

Visibility is independent of replay determinism. Replay artifacts may store information that was never sent to either player during the live match.

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s020 (State hashing)

Replays and recovery need state hashes.

```ts
interface StateHashInput {
  state: GameState;
  includeHidden: boolean;
  normalizeTransientIds: boolean;
}
```

Use canonical JSON serialization:

- Stable object-key ordering.
- Stable array ordering.
- Exclude timestamps unless explicitly part of replay logic.
- Include hidden data for authoritative replay hashes.
- Use separate public-view hash for client sync if useful.

### 06-visibility-security.s007 (Legal-action visibility)

Legal actions can leak hidden information. The view should expose only what that recipient is entitled to know.

Examples:

- The defender should not see exactly why the server auto-passed the counter window.
- A player may see their own legal counter cards.
- The opponent sees only that the game progressed, not whether no counters existed or auto-pass was enabled.

### 11-testing-quality.s007 (Interaction tests)

Representative interactions:

```text
tests/interactions/
  blocker-plus-unblockable.test.ts
  double-attack-plus-banish.test.ts
  replacement-on-ko.test.ts
  simultaneous-ko-triggers.test.ts
  on-ko-source-presence.test.ts
  trigger-during-damage-defers.test.ts
  event-activates-effect-after-resolution.test.ts
  negative-power-stays-on-field.test.ts
  negative-cost-clamps-to-zero.test.ts
```

### 11-testing-quality.s008 (Invariant tests)

Run after every action, decision response, effect resolution, and replay step in test mode.

```ts
assertAllCardsInExactlyOneLocation(state);
assertNoDuplicateInstanceIds(state);
assertCharacterAreaSizeAtMostFive(state);
assertStageAreaSizeAtMostOne(state);
assertLeaderAreaExactlyOne(state);
assertAttachedDonConsistency(state);
assertNoIllegalHiddenInfoInViews(state);
assertPendingDecisionIsValid(state);
assertEffectQueueEntriesAreResolvableOrCancelled(state);
assertStateHashStable(state);
```

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

A pull request must not merge unless the main CI pipeline passes.

Minimum required merge gates:

1. install dependencies with locked versions,
2. build/typecheck workspace,
3. lint workspace,
4. run tests,
5. validate contracts and schemas,
6. validate formatting,
7. publish coverage artifact,
8. fail if generated artifacts or snapshots are stale when the repo defines them.

Recommended CI jobs:

- `quality` -> lint, typecheck, format check
- `engine` -> engine unit, interaction, invariant, replay tests
- `contracts` -> canonical types, DSL schema, fixture normalization, SQL/schema validation
- `client-server-smoke` -> protocol smoke tests and filtered-view checks

For protected branches, require at least one human review plus passing CI.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s008 (Boundary enforcement)

Boundary enforcement is mechanical: `@optcg/engine-core` cannot import React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, or live HTTP clients.

### 15-implementation-kickoff.s012 (Guardrails)

Kickoff guardrails require the engine to stay free of Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, and Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution consumes resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls.

## Story Boundary

Own only behavior-preserving test-file organization for cross-mechanic battle pipeline regression coverage currently in battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts.

## Scope

- move ENG-020 battle/counter pipeline regression coverage from battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts into a focused counter regression file
- move ENG-021C and ENG-021D battle cleanup regression coverage from battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts into a focused cleanup regression file
- move ENG-027D battle K.O. trigger regression coverage from battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts into a focused K.O. regression file
- preserve cross-mechanic event ordering, state hash, and mutation expectations

## Out of Scope

- changing production code
- changing battle pipeline, cleanup, Counter, K.O., or trigger behavior
- moving focused declare-attack, Rush, attack timing, damage, Banish, Character K.O., Blocker, or Counter unit tests

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-pipeline-counter-regression.test.ts
- packages/engine-core/src/battle-pipeline-cleanup-regression.test.ts

- stories/approved/ENG-032I-split-battle-pipeline-regression-tests.yaml
- agent-packets/ENG-032I.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- story-review must pass before moving this story to approved or implementing
- generate and activate only the ENG-032I packet while implementing this story
- target the ENG-032 parent integration branch
- do not run packets:complete after merging only into the parent integration branch
- this is a behavior-preserving test organization story; if a production change appears necessary, stop and split or record an ambiguity
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale
- `@optcg/engine-core` must stay free of React, browser code, WebSocket transport, Redis, Postgres, and live HTTP clients
- The engine must not import Redis, Postgres, WebSocket, React, or Poneglyph HTTP code; once hidden state exists, the client must use `view-engine` instead of `engine-core`, and effect resolution must consume resolved manifests rather than live HTTP calls

## Required Tests

- run corepack pnpm exec vitest run packages/engine-core/src/battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-pipeline-counter-regression.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-pipeline-cleanup-regression.test.ts packages/engine-core/src/battle-pipeline-ko-regression.test.ts
- run corepack pnpm --filter @optcg/engine-core typecheck
- run corepack pnpm run packets:verify
- run corepack pnpm run coverage
- run corepack pnpm run verify

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- battle-pipeline-regression.test.ts no longer contains the moved cross-mechanic regression groups
- focused battle pipeline regression files cover the same scenarios with behavior-equivalent expectations
- no production files change
- focused tests, coverage, and full verify pass

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.

## Agent Instruction Footer

```text
You are implementing a constrained story in an existing codebase.
The cited specification is authoritative.
Do not invent behavior not supported by the cited spec.
Stay within scope.
Stay within the approved story boundary and allowed touch points.
Follow repo tooling and code standard requirements.
Include tests for the listed acceptance criteria.
If the spec is ambiguous, report the ambiguity instead of guessing.
