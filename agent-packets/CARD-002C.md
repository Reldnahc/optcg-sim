## Relevant Spec Excerpts

### 03-game-state-events-decisions.s002 (Canonical state model)

The canonical `GameState` is server-only. It includes hidden information, RNG state, internal queues, snapshots, and metadata.

**v6 contract:** the compile-ready version of every interface in this document is [`contracts/canonical-types.ts`](contracts/canonical-types.ts). Markdown snippets below are explanatory and may be abbreviated. If a snippet conflicts with the contract file, the contract file wins.

Canonical naming decisions:

| Concept                | Canonical name             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| State sequence         | `stateSeq`                 |
| Event collection       | `eventJournal`             |
| Battle sub-state       | `battle`                   |
| Effect queue           | `effectQueue`              |
| Continuous modifiers   | `continuousEffects`        |
| Decision answer action | `Action.respondToDecision` |
| Hidden/server-only RNG | `rng`                      |

Do not use `eventLog`, `activeBattle`, raw JavaScript `Set`, or transport envelopes inside canonical state. Serializable arrays are required for deterministic hashing.

```ts
type PlayerId = string & { __brand: "PlayerId" };
type CardId = string & { __brand: "CardId" };
type InstanceId = string & { __brand: "InstanceId" };
type MatchId = string & { __brand: "MatchId" };
type EngineEventId = string & { __brand: "EngineEventId" };

interface GameState {
  matchId: MatchId;
  status: MatchStatus;
  version: RuntimeVersionSet;
  seq: StateSeq;
  actionSeq: number;
  turn: TurnState;
  players: Record<PlayerId, PlayerState>;
  timers: TimerState;
  battle?: BattleState;
  pendingDecision?: PendingDecision;
  effectQueue: EffectQueueEntry[];
  deferredTriggers: DeferredTriggerBucket[];
  continuousEffects: ContinuousEffectRecord[];
  replacementState: ReplacementProcessState[];
  revealedCards: RevealRecord[];
  rng: RngState;
  eventJournal: EngineEvent[];
  audit: AuditEntry[];
}
```

Canonical live state also carries the authoritative per-player timer snapshot used for `PlayerView` and reconnect/state-sync payloads. Do not fabricate timer values in filtered views.

The browser does not receive this object.

### 04-effect-runtime.s005 (Card implementation support)

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | "vanilla-confirmed"
  | "implemented-dsl"
  | "implemented-custom"
  | "unsupported"
  | "banned-in-simulator";
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

### 09-card-data-and-support-policy.s013 (Match-time card manifest)

At match creation, snapshot resolved card data versions and implementation data. Replays use this manifest instead of live Poneglyph data. The implementation contract is `MatchCardManifest` in `contracts/canonical-types.ts`.

```ts
interface MatchCardManifest {
  manifestHash: string;
  source: "poneglyph" | "poneglyph-fixture" | "manual-test";
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  customHandlerVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  cards: Record<CardId, ResolvedCard>;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### 18-acceptance-tests.s011 (v3 Poneglyph adapter acceptance tests)

```text
PON-001 OpenAPI fixture parses as JSON and exposes /v1/cards/{card_number}, /v1/cards/batch, /v1/search, /v1/cards/{card_number}/text, /v1/formats.
PON-002 Poneglyph detail Zod schema accepts OP01-060 and OP05-091 fixtures.
PON-003 Batch resolver chunks unique card IDs into requests of <=60 IDs.
PON-004 Batch resolver fails match creation if any requested ID is returned in missing.
PON-005 Search result DTO is rejected as a match-manifest source.
PON-006 OP01-060 variant indexes normalize to OP01-060:v0, OP01-060:v1, OP01-060:v2.
PON-007 OP05-091 variant with null product set_code and null market price normalizes without throwing.
PON-008 sourceTextHash changes when effect or trigger text changes.
PON-009 behaviorHash changes when official_faq, errata, stats, type line, effect, or trigger changes.
PON-010 Unreleased cards are rejected in public modes unless explicitly enabled by format policy.
PON-011 variant_index defaults to 0 and generated variant_key is non-null.
PON-012 search result DTO cannot be used to build MatchCardManifest.
PON-013 attributes and colors normalize as arrays.
```

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s011 (Adapter API)

```ts
interface PoneglyphClient {
  getCard(
    cardNumber: CardId,
    options?: { lang?: string },
  ): Promise<PoneglyphCardDetail>;
  getCardsBatch(
    cardNumbers: CardId[],
    options?: { lang?: string },
  ): Promise<{
    data: Record<string, PoneglyphCardDetail>;
    missing: string[];
  }>;
  searchCards(query: PoneglyphSearchQuery): Promise<PoneglyphSearchResult>;
  getPlainText(
    cardNumber: CardId,
    options?: { lang?: string },
  ): Promise<string>;
}

interface CardRepository {
  resolveCard(
    cardId: CardId,
    options?: ResolveCardOptions,
  ): Promise<ResolvedCard>;
  resolveCards(
    cardIds: CardId[],
    options?: ResolveCardOptions,
  ): Promise<ResolvedCard[]>;
  buildMatchManifest(decklists: Decklist[]): Promise<MatchCardManifest>;
}
```

Batch resolution must chunk at 60 card numbers and preserve caller order in the returned manifest.

### 19-poneglyph-api-contract.s012 (Match creation behavior)

1. Collect unique base card IDs from both leaders, main decks, and DON!! decks.
2. Resolve through batch endpoint in chunks of 60.
3. Validate and normalize each returned card.
4. Fail if any requested card appears in `missing`.
5. Merge simulator overlays.
6. Reject unsupported, stale, unreleased, or format-illegal cards according to mode.
7. Snapshot the full match manifest, including hash/version fields.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Each package must expose consistent task names where applicable:

- `build`
- `typecheck`
- `lint`
- `test`
- `test:watch`
- `coverage`

Integration-heavy packages may additionally expose:

- `test:integration`
- `test:replay`
- `test:contracts`
- `test:hidden-info`

At the root, the workspace must provide:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm coverage
pnpm verify
```

`pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command and must run the same core checks as the main merge CI pipeline.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

The repo must define a root `tsconfig.base.json` and package-level `tsconfig.json` files extending it.

Required compiler settings for implementation packages:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

Strongly preferred unless a package-specific exception is justified in writing:

- `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `importsNotUsedAsValues = error`
- `noUnusedLocals`
- `noUnusedParameters`

The repo must not rely on broad TypeScript escape hatches. The following require explicit justification in code review and should be lint-restricted where possible:

- `any`
- non-null assertion (`!`)
- `@ts-ignore`
- `@ts-nocheck`
- unchecked type assertions across trust boundaries

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s005 (Workspace structure and task naming)

Use `pnpm`; the root workspace must provide `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`, and `pnpm verify` is the canonical local pre-push command.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s006 (TypeScript enforcement)

Implementation packages stay in strict TypeScript mode, and broad escape hatches such as `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions require explicit justification.

### 23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.s016 (CI merge gates)

Lint, formatting, and merge-gate verification are mandatory, and CI must fail when checked-in generated artifacts or snapshots are stale.

## Story Boundary

Own root-level integration smoke coverage only. Do not change engine gameplay semantics, card adapter APIs, CLI behavior, hidden-info filtering, server, client, UI, live Poneglyph, or live Redis behavior.

## Scope

- add root integration smoke that may import @optcg/cards and @optcg/engine-core together
- load the representative cards-produced MatchCardManifest fixture produced by CARD-002B
- pass the plain MatchCardManifest into createInitialState
- assert createInitialState accepts the fixture without live Poneglyph, Redis, server, client, or UI code
- keep any engine package tests limited to plain fixture data and not @optcg/cards imports
- do not edit engine-core source in this story

## Out of Scope

- engine-core importing @optcg/cards
- new engine actions
- new gameplay semantics
- server or client integration
- CLI behavior
- broad replay fixture rewrite
- live Poneglyph or Redis

## Allowed Touch Points

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- tests/integration/**
- stories/generated/CARD-002C-root-engine-manifest-integration-smoke.yaml
- stories/approved/CARD-002C-root-engine-manifest-integration-smoke.yaml
- agent-packets/CARD-002C.md
- agent-packets/active.json

## Constraints

- do not add @optcg/cards imports inside packages/engine-core source or package tests
- keep the fixture input plain after it crosses into engine-core
- do not modify gameplay acceptance behavior in this story
- use `pnpm`; the canonical local verification commands are `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm coverage`, and `pnpm verify`
- TypeScript stays strict; avoid `any`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and unchecked trust-boundary assertions without explicit justification
- ESLint with type-aware rules and Prettier formatting are required; CI and local verification must fail when checked-in generated artifacts are stale

## Required Tests

- root integration smoke for cards-produced manifest plus createInitialState
- existing engine-core package tests relevant to initial state
- full `corepack pnpm verify`

## Expected Output

- code changes
- tests
- brief implementation note
- explicit assumptions list

## Acceptance Criteria

- a root integration smoke proves the cards-produced representative manifest can initialize engine state
- the test boundary clearly separates root integration imports from engine package imports
- no live card-data service or cache is required

## Ambiguity Rule

Policy: fail_and_escalate

If the story or cited specification is ambiguous, do not invent behavior. Report the ambiguity and stop at the narrowest safe point.
